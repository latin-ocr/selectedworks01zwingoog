nunmnmon or semsr rmcxs. 209

according to the Catabaptists' desire, and at once the magistracy
is removed and all things follow as they would have them. Good
gods! What a confusion and upturning of everything! For no
one is so destitute of all wisdom in an emergency as this class of
men. Tbey would have everything rectffied by their shouts,
just like that physician‚ or rather queck, who runs to his single
cureall for every sicliness. But, to come to the point, an oath is
an appeal to God in deciding or'vouching for something. This
is not our definition, but his through whom we swear. Ex. xxii.
ro thus commands: If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass or
an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep, and it die or be burt or
driven away by robbers, no one seeing it, then shall an oath of
the lnrd be between them both, that he with whom it was left
hath not put his hand to his neighbor’s goods, and the owner of
the beast shall accept the oath, and he with whom it was left
shall not restore aught. Here you see an oath is an appeal to
God, for it says: An oath of the Iord (orof God), for the word
is mnf, [Yahweh.] But this appesl is nothing but a vowing of
himself to the extreme punishment of the divine wrath ir heis
wrong. For since he calls as witness him, of whom alone he
confesses himself to be aworshiper, and [of him] who can by no
means be deceived, though man may, he bears witness under
penalty of losing him whom alone he worships and who alone .
knows 'the hearts of men, that he is not deceiving and will not
deceive. This authority of Exodus deals with the deciding
[iudicisl] character ol the oath. In Gen. xxi. 23 we have the
words of Abimelech to Abraham, as follows: Therefore swear
unto me by God that thou wilt not harm me nor my posterity,
· etc. And afterward Abraham says: I will swear; and again:
There they both svare. Here again we have an attestation by
God to do something. For Abraham swore to do no barm,
which oath he kept. This, 1 say, is an oath when you define it.
'lhe Catabaptists call it a “decision,'' and omit the appeal to
God, that the simple may not reason thus among themselves.
