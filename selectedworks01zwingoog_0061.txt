01 mouth call themselves Christiana know nothing less than the
divine will. But by their own invented service 01 God, holiness,
external spiritual exhibition, founded upon human eustoms and
laws, they have gone astray, and have thus been persuaded by
those whom people consider learned and leaders 01 others to the
extent that the simple think that such invented external worship
is spiritual, 3ηά that the worship oi God, which they have put
upon themselves, necessariy conduces to happiness, although all
our true happiness, consolation and good consisto, notin our

merits, nor in such extemal works, rather alone in Jesus Christ

my Lords 01 Zurich. Ι made complaint 01 these things before
them as my Lords; 1 have often entreated and begged oi them
in the public pulpit to grant me permission to give an account 01
my sermons and preachings (delivered in their city) before 311 men,
learned or not, spiritual or secular, also before our gracious Lord,
the Bishop 01 Constance, or his representative. This Ι also offered
to do in the city 01 Constance, providing a saie permit was assured
