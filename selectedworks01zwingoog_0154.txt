details, such as abstinence from blood and things strangled, they
in no way permitted believers to be circumcised. For he who is
circumcised becomes a debtor to the whole law; not so he who
eats not blood or things strangled. It does not follow: The
' apostles are not said to have eaten porlr, therefore they did not
eat it. So our reasoning here is: It cannot be proved that
believers’ inlants were not baptized by the apostles because this
is not written, ior there are many things done, both by Christ
and by the apostles, which were not committed to writing. The
lawyers call this a question oi law, not of lact. Something may
exist in law that never issues in fact. It was lawlul ior Paul to

draw bodily nourishment from the field where he sowed spiritual =

seed. For Christ had said that the laborers were worthy ol their
hire. ¹Now as he did not use this lawful right, the reasoning
¹does not iollow: Paul did not receive remuneration lor preach·

over this, your audacity ought to be considered. For when
you cry out among the simple populace against the ministers oi
the gospel that they ought not to gain a living from the gospel:
“ Paul with his hands provided support lor himself and tor others,
in this, as in all other matters, you act with malicious uniaimess.
For he himself (Paul),I say, taught that it was right ior those to
receive support who in tum nourished by the word. The condi-
tion οἱ affairs at that time admonished him, so that he did not .
do what was permissible, as the impious and the false apostles

much Paul discussed on this matter oi fact aud right. You will
η see that it is not only toolish, but impious to argue thus: This is
done, it is therefore done under narrant, this is not done, there-
iore it is not right to do it. I would say then by this expression
nothing else than this: The acts ol the apostles cannot prove
anything more than that the apostles did not baptize iniants-
to grant for the time that they did not—but it does not follow
that they are not to be baptized, or that a negative follows from
