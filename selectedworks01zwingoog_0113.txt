100 zwmcu samoris·

oi the divine sacrament. For of the wealthy, who assembled in
the churches ior the sacrament, some overate themselves and .
became satiated, while the other poor people, at times hungry,

had nothing to eat. This is what st. Paul complains of when
he writes: Whatl have ye not houses to eat ancl to drink in? as
il he were saying the sacrament is not ior the necessity ol the
body, but asa iood for the souis. Therefore St. Paul concludes:
“And the rest will I set in order when I come.” Not that he
wishes to teach otherwise than as Christ has ordered him, but
in order to stop and better their misuse does he say this, which
’ the Word shows: Tradidi vohis, etc.

Secondly, since Sir Vicar pretends that human ordinance and
teaching are to be held, this also is not written in the Gospel;
he refers to St. Paul to the Thessalonians, where he writes:
“Therefore, brethren, stand fastand hold the traditions which
ye have been taught, whether by word or our epistle.” Isay
Paul did not speak, teach, write or instruct in anything except
what the Iord had ordered him. For he testifies everywhere,
and also proves it to be true, to have written or preached naught
except the Gospel oi Christ, which God had promised before in
the Scriptures oi His Son through the propheta*

VICAR.

Maste: Ulrich, you said in your Artlcles that the mass is
no offering. Now Ishall prove that ior14oo years “ missal ”
has been considered a sacrifice and called an offering. For
“ missa ” is a Hebrew word, known by us as sacrifice, and also
the apostles were known as “missam sacrificium.”

Zwingli: Sir Vicar, prove that. Vicat: To-day 1 spoke asa
Vicar; now I speak as a John. Zwingli: Yes indeed3 had
you long before to-day taken off your vicar’s hat it would have
suited you well at times to-day3 then one could have spoken

* [“ And the traditions do not disagree with the Scriptures, so that when
the apostles wrote one thing another was opposed to it.'' (Bullinger.)]
