not cited by Haetzer in the first two debates? Did not l
reply that they were synecdochic, like 1 Cor. x. 'rr All our
fathers were under the cloud? But there were infante also
under the cloud, yet no individual mention is made of them. All

crossed the sea. Yet the infants could not have crossed.
Therefore they crossed who did not, but were borne by those
