(7) When an oath is taken, they say, something future is
promised. But what is promised lor the future when he with
whom his neighbor¹s ass has been left swears that he has not put
his hand to his neighbor's goods? See how learned and pru·
dently you dispone your trides. At first an oath was a decision
only between litigants; now it is onlya promise. What is this
but babbling forth whatever comes into your head? When any

who have scen it say he presents ahorrible appearance. F inally,
like one waking up, he begins to testiiy about what he ¹has heard
and seen while in ecstasy. They have all seen especially that
Zwingli is iu error about catabaptism, and this opinion one pro-

nounces gently and another violeutly. They saw that the day of y
judgment was at hand two years ago, and that catabaptism was ¹
