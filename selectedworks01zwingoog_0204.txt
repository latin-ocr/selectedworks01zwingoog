such a torm oi words as might seem to apply to those votive
processions which we formerly engaged in to the image at Lau·
retum, Baden, Oetingen and elsewhere, while really they con-
demn the processione to the churches appointed lor certain days.
These grieve them, ior they preter those where many meet in
some wood by night rather than by day, when the way home has
to be leit out through the dense darkness by the more comely
girls and matrons, and they consummate spiritual marriages with
carnal copulation; or where two or three meet at the house oio
man who is a little better off, and eat and chat, lead astray the
women, and in aword do many things you would hardly dare
imagine. By this hunting they find much greater booty thanis
their auditors should hear in the assemblage oi the churches
what is against their doctrines. For who will protect the ioolish
girls and women and cormtrymeu and simpletons from wolves oi
this sort when they never openly appear, nor after the manner ol
the apostles go to the synagogues first and disclose the sources oi
their doctrines in the Scriptores* But ior some months they will
waste the time with some worthless idler and contaminate the
whole family not only with error, but with harlotry also, and then
appear in some spot. And as soon as they are asked to give the
reason ior their doctrine they fly away and leave the featherless
chick to the hawk. Thus they are at variance with both the
word and institution ol Christ, who both said: “ In secret havel
said nothing,'’ and commanded that what they heard in the ear
they should preach upon the housetop. Now see these circum-
cised! Having gained permissiou oi some house owner they
ascend the root, and there caw out that they are now iuliilling
what Christ said: preach upon the housetop‚ etc. But when a
traveler or policeman is seen at a distance they turn tail, as is

recorded in the labie oi the little lox. Now they condemn states J

θ The authorities, with Zwingli's assent, first lorced these oppressed people κ
into holding secret meelings, it they met at all, and now Zwingli taunts them ,

lor their secrecyl Ales.
