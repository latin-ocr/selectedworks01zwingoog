by which, freed from the body, it persists and exists in life,
oppressed neither by sleep nor death, for it cannot be so
overcome.*l

In Josh. vii. 12 the Lord says: The children of Israel could not
stand (surgo) before their enemies‚ and a little after [verse 13] :
Thou canst not stand before thy enemies. Here in both places to
rise is put for to stand fast and steady. For Jerome also translates
“to stand.’' In Matt. xxii. 31 Christ says: Touching the resur-
rection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto
you by God, saying: I arn the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead,
but of the living. By which reply he taught nothing else but that
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are living, though dead. Of whom
the Sadducees either denied the resurrection, ι’. a, living, or at
least, after Catabaptist fashion, asserted that they [the dead]
slept. For Christ’s reply referred not to the resurrection of the
flesh, but to the lact that Abraham, Isaac and jacob lived,
though dead. So Paul speaks in Heb. xi. 35: But others were
tortured (or crucified), not accepting deliverance, that they might
obtain a better resurrection. Notice here how resurrection is
used for the life of souls, which they are to have when released
from the hody. ln this sense they so embraced the life that
follows this that they would not accept the present life even when
it was offered. So firm was their faith that they were sure the
life that followed would be better. Whence also the saying of
Christ in John vi. 40 : Iwill raise him up at the last day, ought
not to be distorted to any sense other than: “ 1 will preserve
him in lile when he dies who trusts in me.” So he either implies

tbe sleep of the soul. It received very elaborate refutation lrom the youthful
Calvin: Psychopannychia, qua refellitur quorundam imperitorum error, qui
animas postmortem usque ad ultimum judicium dormire putant. Libellus
