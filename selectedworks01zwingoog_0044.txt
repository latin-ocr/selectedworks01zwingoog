it.” He meant, no doubt, that they to whom it was granted
from above were bound to keep the law. For otherwise none
could hold out under it. We, then, having tried with little
enough success alas! to obey the law (ior the disease must be
boldly disclused to the physician), have discovered that the gift
has been denied unto us, and we have meditated long within
ourselves how we might remedy our ill-started attempts at
chastity. And turning the matter over on all sides, we iound
nothing encouraging or propitious until we began to chew the
ends, it were, like the cattle, over those words ol Christ just
quoted. For then a sort oi loathing oi ourselves began to creep
over us from the odour of it until we began to be disgusted that
through careless thinking we had made a law unto ourselves ol
that which Christ had leit lree, as il the maintenance ol chastity
depended upon our own strength. Then presently a blush oi
shame overspread our laces, just as Adam, when he was going to
be like the gods, found first nothing but his own nakedness, then
an angry God, and shortly alter a whole cart-load ol ills. For
who would not repent when he had looked upon the pitiable
result of his own carelessness? For what else is it, by the ever-
lasting God, than absolute iolly, uay even shamelessness‚ to arro-x
gate to one’s seli what belongs to God alone? To think one's
seli able to do that than which thereis nothing one is less able
to do? But aiter that loathing of ourselves, through which we
recognized at once our rashness and our weakness‚ the hope of a
remedy began to show itseli, though lrom alar. ¹For weighing
more carefully Christ’s words and the custom oi our predecessors
in this matter, we found that the whole question was iar easier
than we had thought. For when he says, “All men cannot
receive this sayiug,'' and] again, “ He that is able to receive it,
let him receive it,'’ he prescribes uo punishment for them that
cannot receive it. Nay, either because of the vastuess of the
thing which he did not wish enjoined upon each and all, or on
account ol our weaknes, which he knows better than we ourselves,
