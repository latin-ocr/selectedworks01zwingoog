01 two peoples, two churches and two covenants. See Gen. xxv.
23 and Gal. iv. 22. Το which my answer is: ilhenever there is
held in Scripture that there are two distinct and diverse peoples,
necessarily 022 01 these is 201 1122 people 01 God. For both
when the Jews were God's people aad we who are Gentiles were
not, and now when we who are Gentiles are God's people and
the Jews are cut 011, there is only 022 people 01 God, 201 two.
In Gen. xxv. 23 we read: Two peoples shall be separated 120212
thy bowels, it is not to 122 understood as though both were and
would be his people at the same time. But Jacob he loved and
Esau he hated belore they struggled in her wonrb. Τ122221022
ever one and the same people is that which cherishes the one
true and only God, from whatsoever parents it was born. And
again, they 222 diverse who lollowa diverse cultus, though one
and the same birth-paug produce them. When therefore he
spolre 01 two peoples lormerly, one was Jewish‚ the other Gentile.
The Jew worshiped the high God, but the Gentile was impious.
Now when we spealr 01 1122 church 01 1122 Gentiles, it is the same
now as that former one 01 1122 Jews, and the people ol the Gen·
tiles or the impious are [now] the people ol Israel. For we are
put in their place 21122 they have been cut off, not in 20222 place
next them. But two covenants are spoken ol, not that they are
two diverse covenants, 102 11212 would necessitate 201 only two
diverse peoples, but also two gods. Since some ancients did not
see this, they taught that two diverse gods existed, one 01 1122
Old, the other 01 1122 New Testament; the one cruel, the other
gentle and kind* So Paul indeed speaks 01 two testamenta, but
the one he calls 2 1221222221 by a misuse 01 language, when he
wishes thern to be understood who, although they were under
that one eternal covenant and testament, yet 02 account 01 1122
2211222212 which they tenaciously retained betrayed the light and
Christ himself. Paul therefore called the way 01 112222 212212-
ment, not that it was a true testament, but by a copying or
