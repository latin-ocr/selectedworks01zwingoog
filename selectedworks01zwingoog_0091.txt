by several, and thus referring to Cyprianus. But the vicar
demanded thatone should record the words oi Master Ulrich,
because he believes he may catch him in small matters, ior Master
Ulrich may not have been very careiul in the use oi his words.
Thereiore he also demands that a copy oi Cyprianus should be
brought, so that the dispute may be decided. But the vicar
said: Supposing the words oi Cyprianus are as 1 think, and not
as you? And thereupon a quarrel arose, which had naught to do
with the questions which the vicar had been called upon so often
to answer. Thereiore l have not taken pains to remember and
note this. But ii 1 understood the matter both were right. For
Zwingli reierred to those who had been baptized by heretice,
who should, according to Cyprianus, be baptized again in the
churches, which several thought was needless. But the vicar was
speaking oi those who once baptized by Christiana had gone over
to heresy aud later on wished to reinter the Christian Church;

these did not need another baptism, but merely absolution by the
imposition oi hands, etc. Several were, however, also opposed to
this, as Cyprianus writes in his letters to Pompeius and to Quintinus.

Alter there had been considerable talk concerning this matter,

there; studied in Paris the classical tongues and Hebrew‚ anrl carne horne in
1520 as a Doctor oi the Sacred Scriptores, and the same year he taught iu the
Franciscan monastery in Zurieh and so carne in contact with Zwingli. He
embraced the Reformation, and introduced it into Luceme and into Schaii·
hausen (both 1525), whither persecution drove him. lt is indeed as the Re·
lormer ol Schaiihausen that he is best remembered, yet his career there was
briei, ior in 1525 he had to leave that city. He preached in Zurieh (1526)
and taught Hebrew in Bern (1528), but died September 26, 1533, as preacher
at Zohngen, thirty nriles southeast oi Basel. Two ol his writings were corn·
monly attributed to Zwingli.
