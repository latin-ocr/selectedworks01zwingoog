saumarios or ωηεν mers. 143

But it says in the same place that the apostles baptized. For we
should at once reply: Oh, if the apostles rightly baptized, even
though Christ himself did not, we, too, rightly baptiza infanta,
though the apostles did not. There is no difference in the
cases, or rather our case is the stronge13 we have Christ's not
baptiziug, yet the legitimacy of baptism 3 you have the apostles
only, who did not baptize infants (supposing we grant that they
did not), yet none the less, infants are to be baptized. For
since baptism is legitimate, though Christ did not baptiza so is
baptism of infants‚ though the apostles did not baptize thern,
unless it is forbidden by another necessity which prevents the
baptism of infants. As to your reply in the second place to the
examples and facts which I adduced, as follows: Grant that itis
true (i. a, that nothing can be proved by the deeds of the
apostles unless it is clear that they acted legitimately), the
obscure testimony which he adduces conceming Paul's act cannot
therefore even in his own opinion prove anything. In this you
have a fine answer; you turn the tables upon me beautifully.
For if by acts one cannot prove legitimacy, but one must examine
what is legitimate, then that Paul baptized infants in the familias
of Stephanas, Lydia and the iailor, cannot prove infant baptism.
For I was not here intending by these examples to confirm as
upon a foundation the baptism of infants‚ but showing how rash
and false was your argument when you said that the apostles
never baptized [infants]‚ for you have no testimony to this3 and
then to prove that it was more likely than not that they baptized,
Ilaid as the foundation the saying: The children of believers are
as much within the church and as much among the sons of God
as are their parents. ’
Catabapmu. Third. Just before this fundamental argument
of Zwingli's Paul says: Some of the family of Chloe tell me that
there are strifes andcontentions among you, etc. [1 Cor. i. 11.]
As here infants announced and could announce nothing (for they
could know nothing), so the infants of Stephanas’ family were not
