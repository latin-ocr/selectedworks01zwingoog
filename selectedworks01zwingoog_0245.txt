citizens with the saints and oi the household oi God, built upon
the foundations oi the apostles and propheta Jesus Christ himseli
being the chiei comer-stone, etc. By which words Paul means
throughout what I do in the present, i. a, that one people has
been made oi both through one Christ Jesus, who bas united into
one both those who once were near and us who were most distant.
Weigh careiully, good reader, the words of Paul, and you will find
abundantly what we assert here. F or there is no need oi treating
at length so holy 3ηά evident a proposition.

Also Heb. xii. 22 ι But ye are come unto Mount Zion aud to
the city oi the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, 3ηά to an
innumerable company oi thousands oi angels, and to the church
oi the first-born that are written in heaven, and to God the
Judge oi all, etc. By which words also Paul teaches that through
Christ we are united to the people oi God.

And 311 the apostles believed this, that there is one testament,
one people oi God in 311, i. a, from the least to the greatest they
are considered within the people oi God, and that 'there is oue
church oi God compacted out oi all peoples through one spirit
into one. For Peter iu Acts ii. 36 says: That 311 the house oi

Israel may know assuredly that God hath made Lord and Christ 1

this Jesus whom ye have crucified. As he says here that

Jesus was made theJChrist, that is Messiah, the Saviour to the ¹
Jews, therefore also the Jews have salvation. And a little· J

after (he says): The promise is to you 3ηά your children, and
to all that are aias off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.
Here he asserts that the promise was not only to those who then
heard, but to their children also, who were either born or were
to be born. So in [Acts] iii. 2 5 this same Peter says: Ye are the
children oi the prophets and of the covenant which God made
with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall
all the kindreds oi the earth be blessed. Here he makes Christ
belong to the Jews, through him alone they as well as we are
saved. For became first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles.
