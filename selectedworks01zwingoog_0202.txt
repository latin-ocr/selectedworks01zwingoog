Christ according to the measure oi wickedness that is in the
world. We ought to be alien and separate from all oi these,
they are pure abominations, which make us hateiul to Christ, who
has freed us irom servitude to the flesh and made us fit ior the
service oi God through the spirit oi God which he has given us.
By the strength oi this constitution there iall away from ns the
devilish arms ot violence, such as swords and other arms and
things oi this character, and all use oi them tor either friend or
enemy by reason ol this word oi Christ: Ye must not resist evil.

Reply. What they mean by so confused a statement, which is
ao torn and patched that it contains nothing sound and fresh,
you would hardly divine it they had not said in the title oi the
work that they dealt with the avoidance of abominable pastors in
the church. First, they have so heaped together those statements
oi nothing in the world but good and evil, Christ and Belial, and
the other matters these divine men have piled up together, that
they would be very tine, and would give a reason ior not assem-
bling in our churches. You must not suppose this is horror of
popish pastors. It is against ns they rail in this fashion. For
they meet with the popish and do not shun their meetings. We
who stand by the gospel are assailed here. The reason is that
we alone show up and shun catabaptism and their wholesale
sedition. By the papists we are called heretics, by the catabap-
tists secundopapists, because we preserve in the church iniant
baptism and some other things which they will have nothing of.
So are we exercised in the Lordâ€™s glory that we may bring to him
avictory the more excellent the more numerous those are by
whom we are assailed. I will show in a few words the deceit
they conceal iu the words ol this article. What they allege from
Scripture about separation is not said in the sense to which they
wrest it. For otherwise we should be compelled to retire not
only from the world, as Paul says, but also irom the church.
For there is nothing human so holy and blameless that it does
not fail in some part. We ought therefore first to be separated
