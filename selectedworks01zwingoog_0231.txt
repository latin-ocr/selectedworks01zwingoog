often done before and had persisted in doing. Indeed, he had ἵ
always acted as if he would rather die than take an oath. The

official of the senate then ordered him to lift his hands aud make r

oath at once when put to the question, “or do you, policeman,''
said he, “lead him back to prIson.'’ But now, persuaded by rods,
this George of the house ot Jacob raised his hands to heaven
and followed the magistrate in the reading of the oath. So here

the divine apostle said not of those who are not within the

but of those who are not without the church. Among these
therefore he declares that allis confirmed or decided by an oath.
Nor do they consider, as I have warned them, what was said
above about witnesses testifying about a bishop, nor this, that
neither Christ nor the apostles ever taught that the statement
that every word stands or falls by the utterance of two or three
witnesses had been made void, as is easily seen by Matt. xviii· 16
and Heb. x. 28. From these they might have learned that an
oath was never abolished, although they had no word but:
