For 1 am no orator or poet, and do not pretend to be. Finally
Isay, the evangelica} and apostolical Scriptura is not found in
the wise, brilliant or flowery, smooth words, but in the power oi
God, as Paul says, 1 Cor. ii. 4. Thus, as before, it seems to me
not to be sufficient that one apply or bring iorward Scripture,
but it is also important that one understand Scripture correctly.
With that in view perhaps one should attend to such matters ¹at
the universities (as at Paris, Cologne or Lyons‚ or elsewhere), as
. I said before.

ANSWER OF MASTER ULRICH.

sn Vrcrn: There is no further need of such smooth and round-
about words. I desire that you tell me only withwhat portion oi

Scripture you convinced the priest imprisoned at Constance,
’ clergyman of Fislisbach, that he was not a Christian, and brought χ(
him to a revocation oi his error. This is the point upon which
we desire to hear in kindness your answer. Show us simply
where in the books heretoiore cited by you in the matter ol
praying to the saints and oi their intercession it is stated that
they are our mediators. This we desire to know from you.
Tberefore I beg you ior the sake oi Christian love, do this with
plain, unadulterated‚ divine Scriptum, as you boast to have done
in the case oi the priest imprisoned at Constance. Indicate the
chapter and answer the question as asked in simple words, saying
here or there it is written. Then we will see ir it is so, and in
case we are persuaded and convinced oi it we will gladly submit
to instruction. There is no need oi long speeches.* For your
long quoting and citing oi many writings oi the ancients looks
nrore like seeking the praise and favor of the audience than the
furthering oi the truth. ProbablyI also could bring in many
narratives and essays of the ancients, but it is not to the point.
We well know that many things were decided upon in times
