Old Testament, nay, Christ himself used no other, and what

, controversy arose about baptism would have to be settled by its

authority, but since this not even leads us to think anything but
that baptism, the sign oi the covenant, must be given to infante
equally with circumcision, there'could have been no hesitation

ascension ot Christ), that we may not ignore the antiquity oi
iniant baptism, and at the same time that we may attain to cer·
tainty that beyond all controversy the apostles baptized iniants.
So the Catabaptists do nothing at all different irom the false
apostles in former tmes, oi whom Paul thus spealrs: They order
you to be circumcised for this only, that they may glory in your

Ι ilesh. So these men glory in mobs and their seditious, or rather
heretical, church. For I assert truly that iu our time no dogma,
' however unheard oi, can so rightly be called heresy as this sect's,
ior they have separated themselves from the churches ol believers,
they have rebaptired, and have their own assemblages. Now I
