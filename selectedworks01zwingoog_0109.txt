me to consider and rcfute them as though wrong.

When my Sir Vicar speaks and quotes lrom the Gospcl‚ “ He
that is not against us is lor us‚” I say that is true. “Now the
customs and ordinances of the Church are ordered and decrced
by men, not against God,” etc. Sir Vicar, prove that. For
Christ always despises human ordinance and decree, as we have
in Matt. xv. 1-9. When the Jews and Pharisees blamed and Ι
attached the Lord because his disciples did not obcy the doc-
trine and ordinance ol the ancients Christ said to thern: “Why
do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradi-
tion?” etc. And the Lord spoke further: “Ye hypocrites, well
did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This peoplc draweth nigh
unto me with their mouth and knoweth me with their lips, but
their heart is lar from me. Burin vain do they worship me,
tcaching for doctrines the commandments of men.’¹ One sces
here that God does not desire our decree and doctrine when

they do not originatc with Him, despises them, and says we
serve Him in vain, which also St. Paul shows to us when he
writes thus: Dcar brethren, let no man bcguilc you by human
wisdom and deecit, in accordance with the doctrine or decree
ol mcn, in accordancc with the doctrines ol this world, and not

those ol Christ. “ Let no man therefore judgc yon in mcat, or
in drink, or in respect ol a holiday, or ol a new moon, or ol the
Sabbath days. Which arc a shadow ol things to come‚” etc.
Colli. 1613. God wants from us His decree‚ His will alone,
not our opinion. God the Lord cares more for obedience to
His word (although they use the word “ obedience ¹' lor human
obedience) than lor all our sacrifices and scil-created church
usagcs, as wc have it in all thc divine writings ol the prophete,
twclve apostlcs and saints. The greatest and correct honor to
show to God is to obcy His word, to live according to His will,
not according to our ordinances and best opinion.
