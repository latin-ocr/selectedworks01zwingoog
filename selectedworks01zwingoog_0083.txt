and were saved, though they did not hold to the intercession ol
the saints, and perhaps knew little ot it, then it follows that they
did not sin who believed in Christ alone and did not consider

For we know really from the Scriptores that Jesus Christ alone
is the mediator between us and God, his heavenly Father, as has
been stated before. Furthennore, I say that many learned men
