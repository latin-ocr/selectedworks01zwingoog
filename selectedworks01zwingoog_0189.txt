The thing itseli compels me willy nilly‚ good reader, to cease
, to give the vain words ol the Catabaptists and to draw to a close.
So hereaiter I will act thus: I will untie every huot, and what-
everis said by them that has any force I will adduce with such
fidelity as I have thus tar in rendering it literally into Latin. And
ior this reason in particular, that what they have thus iar adduced
against the figurative sense has been in great part reluted. What

they have argued about the Testament will be so treated and 3

torn away when we reach the Testament.

The arguments against the synecdoche in 1 Cor. x. 9: All our
fathers were under the cloud, they all crossed the sea, all were
baptized unto Moses, all ate the same spiritual foed-the argu-
ments, 1 say, that they barli out against these synecdoches are so
loolish and impure that they are not to be taken into account·
For they say they know that they ate, drank, crossed the sea,
went to stool and urinated, but it must be proved by us by clear
Scripture that infants were baptized. Alter that they insult us
this way: See now how Zwingli stands with his synecdoche, which
he affirms with his own peculiar cunning and sophistry, lest by
acknowledging the truth he may suffer the persecution of the
cross ol Christ. What can you do with these men? That Ι might
expound synecdoche correctly Ι adduced these examples, which
they are so lar from tearing away that he who will may use them,
not only as examples of synecdoche, but to show also thatin the
apostles’ time believers’ iniants were baptized, as l have indicated
above. They approach the matter with bitterness, since they
can do nothing by the sharp energy oi the word ol God. They
charge cunning and sophistry, which Ι so express my abhorrence
ol that all my'writings can free me from the charge better than
any oration prepared tor this purpose. But Ι recognize and cher-
ish the truth. And I should have to endure nothing if Ι should

adopt your opinion, unless you are most mendacious, for you have
promised oftener than l can say that all will eventuate happily ir
I join you. But you had to have recourse to calumnies and shouts
