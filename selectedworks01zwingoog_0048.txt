PERMISSION TO MARRY· 35

some extent who have forbidden marriage we refrain from saying
now, thinking it enough that the fire of passion alone (and that
so frequent and violent as to threaten the mind) is pronounced
sufficient reason for marriage. The fourth passage is verse a 5 in
the same chapter: “Now conceming virgins I have no com-
mandment of the Lord: yet l give my judgment,” etc. Paul,
the teacher of the nations, the chosen instrument of God, with
whom Christ had spoken intimately from heaven more than
once, says that he has no commandment of the Lord in regard to
virginity, and has an unpurified man such commandment?
Then too Paul had said much of the value of virginity and its
advantages‚ and much of the trials and unhappiness of marriage,
and he added, verse 35, “And this I speak for your own profit 3
not that I may cast a snare upon you‚” wishing, though he had
greatly praised the state of virginity, not to seem of opinion that
it ought to be commanded. The fifth passage is 1 Timothy iii.
1, foll: “This is a true saying, If a man desire the office ofa
bishop, he desireth a good work. A bishop then must be blame·
less, the husband of one wife,” etc. And a little later he adds
“having his children in subiection with all gravity.’' Here we Ι
noted that though it is a thing of high repnte to be a bishop, yet
he bids a bishop have a wife, whether one only or.one ata time
we will not now discuss. We noted also that the name bishop
is the name of an office, not one of arrogant pride, and therefore
we had no fear to call ourselves also bishops, that is, watchers,
because the other terms which arsin common use to-day either
seem over-ambitious or are foreign words. With the name of
watcher, however, how can any one be puffed up? Can he
tlrink it a state of high dignity and not a position of duty when
the only fonction of awatcher is to watch? The sixth passage
is from the same Paul'to Titus 1, 5 and 6 : “For this cause left
I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that
are wanting, and ordain elders in every city ; ifany be blame-
less, the· husband of one wife, having faithful children,” ete. ,
