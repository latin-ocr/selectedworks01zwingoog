Reply. 1 will not interpret the whole oi this paragraph in its

ᾗ prolixity at once, but divide it into parts, and coniute it as
ς briefly as possible. Thereiore when they say that the sword is
,γ an ordinance oi God outside the perlection oi Christ, etc, I
would know to what they refer the perfectiori oi Christ, to the
³. head or the body, i. a, do they mean to say: Christ himself is so

,L perfect that he needs no sword (ι’. a, the magistracy,) to chastise

,ζ , or punish himself, or do they mean that Christians need no sword
ᾗ or magistracy? It the first, Ι assert that the iord oi lords and

King ol kings is so lar from needing magistracy that all magis-

the second, I strive with all my powers against the proposition
that Christians need no magistracy. For I grant this, that it is
easy ior them to say that a real Christian needs no magistracy,

ἠ lor oi iaith he omits none oi those things that ought to be done
and does none oi the deeds that are not right. But it is our

'' wholly happy, as long as we bear about this domicile oi the body.

Thereiore the saying: The sword is an ordinance oi God outside

ἱ of the perfectiori oi Christ is true in this sense-wherever the
members oi Christ do not arrive at the measure of the perlection
i oi the head there is need tor the sword. But they mean some·
,Α thing else entirely, i. a, that the heretical church of the rebap-
J tized needs no sword, ior it is within the perlection ol Christ.
“¹ For the ioolish men assume what the monks used to assume, vin,
χ that they are in a state oi perlection, although they do not use
’ those words. For when they separate from the world, crying to
’ brethren of the same kidney, “ Go ye out from them,” do they
j do anythin‘g but guard themselves from being defiled by some
’ἶ filth from us? Atterwards when they say: But in the perfectiori ’
⁵ ol Christ we use excommunication only, etc, you see how they

say: We use. These most seditious men therefore would take
