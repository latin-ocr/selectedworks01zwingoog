Saint 'Paul says, 1 Cor. vii. 32: “Qui sine uxore,” etc. “He
that is unmanied careth for the things that belong to the lord.”
vii. 27: “Solutus es ab,'' etc. “Art thou loosed from a wife?
seek not a wife !'' There he speaks of those who serve the
Gospel as priests. Id. vii. 20: “Let every man abide in the
same calling wherein he was called.¹' Such and many other
causes have induced the holy fathers not to allow and permit

set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders (whom
we call priests or deacons) in every city, as 1 had appointed thee:
If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
children,” etc. Undoubtedly the holy Paul, inspired by the Holy
Ghost, recognized our inability and incapacity to remain chaste
by our own will except through the grace of God. Hence he
says in the afore-mentioned place, 1 Cor. vii. 7: “For 1 would
