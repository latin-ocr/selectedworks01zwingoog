prayers made over infanta, on the ground that neither John nor
the apostles are said to bave begun or celebrated baptism with
prayer. To which I replied, first as to ceremonial: Christ re-
stored some blind men to sight by the medium oi touch oroi mud
others by the words ‘⁴ Receive thy sight '’ alone, and they saw no
