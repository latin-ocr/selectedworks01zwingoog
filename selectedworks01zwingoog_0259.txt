predestinated, before the world was, to be saved through his Son, i
as Paul teaches in Eph. i. 4.

Α second pair oi inlerences also follows. First, they teach
incautiously who say thet the baptism ol infante can be tolerated ,
through love, unless they mean that by love all things are done l
among Christians, and not by command and by force oi law, just l

as Paul says: Owe no one sught, but to love one another. But
it they receive love in the place oi complaisance and indulgence,

as when Paul through love sheared his hair and undertook a ,

vow (ior he did this by indulgence in which he spared the wealr),
now l think they err seriously who say that through love inlants
should be baptized. For what do they mean by this other than
that now one may not omit lor the sake ol public peace what
some time must be omitted when it is permitted? Let them
therefore receive my opinion alter considering the distinction oi
love which I premise. Few ceremonies have been leit ns by

Christ—two or three, baptism, the eucharist and the laying on oi l
hands. The first belongs in general to all who are ol Christ's l

church. The second to those only who can interrogate them·

selves upon their certitude oi laith. For the apostle says: Let a ¹
man prove himself. The third only to a lew, those who superin- i
tend the ministry oi the word. Now since these ceremonies have ’
clear methods oi perlormance they are improperly said to be ζ

done oi love when they are done ol precept, even though what·

ever God commands is most pleasing to you because of your ,

piety. So when it is said: Go and teach all natione, baptizing
them into the name oi the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, there is
here the lorm ol law as much ss in “ Let every male be circum·
cised.'’ What the law orders cannot be ascribed to indulgence,
but that is done of indulgence when at the celebration ol the
eucharist certain weak ones are spared, and would be so done it
the habit oi baptizing iniants were being restored and certain
weak ones were spared from being compelled to baptize inlants
aiter the custom andurite. This, l say, would be done of love.
