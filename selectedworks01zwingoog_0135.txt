adultery, it will be necessary that a severe punishment be placed
upon adultery, lor it was forbidden in the Old Testament on pain
oi stoning to death. ⁴

The preachers to whom the Word oi God and superintendence
(oi morals) are commended shall ban and exclude such sinners
from the Christian parish, but the corporal punishment and the
matter oi the 'property shall be referred to the civil authorities.

But that no one ior this reason may iear marriage, and resort .

to prostitution, these sinuers, too, as is now announced, shall be ·
excluded.

Since, now, marriage was instituted by God to avoid unchastity,
and since it often occurs that some, by nature or other shortcom·
ings, are not fitted ior the partners they have chosen, they shall
nevertheless live together as friends ior a year, to see il matters
may not better themselves by the prayers ol themselves and ol
other honest people. Ii it doe's not grow better in that time, ²
they shall he separated and allowed to marry elsewhere.

Lilrewise, greater reasons than adultery, as destroying life,
.endangering lile, being mad or crazy, offending by whorishness,
vor leaving one's sponse without permission, remaining abroada
„long time, having leprosy, or other such reasons, oi which no rule
·can be mdae on account ol their dissimilarity-these cases the
yudges can investigate, and proceed as God and the character oi
the cases shall demand.

The ordinances shall he careiully and repeatedly announced by
all clergymen, and their parishes wamed against trespassing them.

Given at Zurich on Wednesday, the roth ol May, in the year
