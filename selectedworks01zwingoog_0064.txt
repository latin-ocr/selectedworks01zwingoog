Ι undertake to dispute anything here at Zurich. For, as 1 think,
such matters are to be settled by a general Christian assembly of
all nations, or by a council of bishops and other scholars as are
found at universities, just as occurred in times past among the
holy apostles in Jerusalem, as we read in Acts xv. For if such
matters touching the common customs 3ηά the praiseworthy
usages of the past were discussed, 3ηά some decision reached
against them, such changes would perhaps not please other
Christiana dwelling in other places, who would doubtless assert

, thar they had not consented to our views. For what would those

iu Spain, in Italy, in France and in the North say about it? Such
things must surely, as Isaid, be ratified 3ηά maintained as
· formerly, by a general council, in order to be valid elsewhere.
Therefore‚ dear lords,I speak now for myself. Asa Christian
member and brother in Christ Ι beg and urge you to consider
these things well, lest hereaiter further and greater strife and
harm may result. Accordingly it would be my sincere advice
to drop any difference or dissension that may have arisen con-
ceming papal or other ecclesiastical ordinances (constitutions)
of long standing, and without further disputing to lay aside and
postpone them, to see if they could not be arranged meantime
more peacefully 3ηά advantageously. For my gracious Lord of
Constance is informed that it is decided at Nuremberg by the
estates (Strinden) of the empire to hold a general council of the
German nation within a year, in which I hear half the judges
selected are secular and the other half ecclesiastical, and they
are to judge and decide about the things which are now disturb
ing nearly all the world. If such takes place these matters
should be referred to them as having the authority and power.
And so it is the earnest desire of my Inrd, astar as possible, to
have such differences about the clergy settled without dispute
for the good of yourselves 3ηά 311 (other) Christians. For
though these old ordinances, lawa 3ηά customs should be dis-
cussed pro and con upon scriptural basis, who would be judge of
