my biography alluded to above, in which will be lound Pro-
fessor Melouth¹s translation in run of the sermon upon tasting,
preached in the spring oi 1522, which was the first published
reformation document in Switzerland3 and the Confession ol
Faith presented by Zwingli at the Diet ot Augsburg‚ 1530,

translated by Rev. Henry E. Jacobs, D. D., LL.D.‚ Professor '

in the Evangelical Lutheran Seminary, Philadelphia, Pa. 3 re-
printed by permission, from Dr. Jacohs’ edition of the Book os
Concord, Philadelphia, the best edition ol that important collec-
tion and its accompanying documents. Also‚ Ι would say that
in 1899, in Collegeville, Pa„ there appeared a translation of
Zwingli¹s “Christian Education ot Youth,’' by Professor Reichen·
bach, oi Ursinus College, Philadelphia. I am not auare that
there are any other accessible English translations oi Zwingli’s
prose writings, but in my biography appear in English many
extracts from Zwingli’s correspondence and from documents
bearing upon him.
