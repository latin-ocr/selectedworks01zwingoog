110111 you. And this the fact itsell shows, 101 we should never
have ventured to write to your Fatherhood unless we had had
thorough confidence in it. We desire, therefore, humbly to beg
you to listen kindly to what we are going to disclose a little later,
to hear it graciously, and to talre it in good part. This is de·
manded both by the matter itseli which drives us to this appeal
and by the office which you fill as a loving iather. The matter
itseli, to come to it at last, is this: Your Most Reverend Father-

perished themselves. And though we do not by any means
willingly predict this same ill-omened end 101 the present mis-
guided lot, we cannot help iearing that it may corne to pass
sometime, and 101 that we are not without reasons. Foras in
the old days the Jews cast out in vain 110111 the synagogue those
