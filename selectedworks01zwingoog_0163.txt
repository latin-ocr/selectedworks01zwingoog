such persistency and wantonness! But iu vain do Ι offer you
this alternative, ior you will never admit your spirit to be a lying
one. Iwill arraign it then by the very power oi him who silences
the kind of spirit in which you abound, so that it does no more
dare to assert: Thou art the Son ol God. For as falsely and
faithlessly as you did they say: Thou art the son oi God. For

even the human reason oi wise men reaches the same conclusion,
so that it sees that man thinks aud does nothing except by his

mentary ior this purpose—it would take too long to repeat this

makes clear to us that man within and at heart is worthless and

evil. For ¹man is not told to inspect himself that he may con·
