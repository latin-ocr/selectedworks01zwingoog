same tirne with books referred to and Scriptures quoted, so that
the Scriptures, and not they, were the judges. The Scriptures
are so much the same everywhere, the Spirit of God flows so
abundantly, walks in them so joyfully, that every diligent reader,
in so lar as he approaehes with humble heart, will decide by

and labors to read the Scriptures, and especially those who are
preachers and caretakers of the soul, let each one buya New
Testament in Latin, or in German, if he does not understand the
Latin or is unable to interpret it. For 1 also am not ashamed to
read German at times, on account of easier presentation. Let
one begin to read first the gospel of St. Matthew, especially the
