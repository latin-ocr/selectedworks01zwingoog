Ι* Χ. As that man is mad whose limbs (try to) do something
without his head, tearing, wounding, iniuring himself; thus when
the members of Christ undertake something without their head,
Christ, they are mad, and injure and burden themselves with un·
wise ordinanees.

XI. Hence we see in the clerical (so-called) ordinances, con·
cerning their splendor, riches, classes, titles, laws,a cause of all
foolishness, for they do not also agree with the head.

XII. Thus they still rage, not on account of the head (for that

one is eager to bring forth in these times from the grace of God,)
but because one will not let thern tage, but tries to compel them
to listen to the head.

XIII. Where this (the head) is hearlrened to one learns clearly
and plainly the will of God, and man is attracted by his spirit to
him and changed into him. .

XIV. ThereIore all Christian people shall use their best

diligence that the Gospel of Christ be preached alilre everywhere.
XV. For in the faith rests our salvation, and in unbelief our
damnation; for all truth is clear in him.
XVI. In the Gospel one learns that human doctrines and de-
crees do not aid in salvation.

ABOUT THE POPE.

XVII. l'hat Christ is the only etemal high priest, wherefrom it
follows that those who have called themselves high priests have
opposed the honor and power of Christ, yea, cast it out.

ABOUT 'I'IIE Mass.

XVIII. That Christ, having sacrificed himself once, is to eter-
nity a certain and valid sacrifice for the sins of all faithful, where-
from it follows that the mass is not a sacrifice, but is a remem-
brance of the sacrifice and assurance of the salvation which Christ
has given us.

XIX. That Christ is the only mediator between God and us.
