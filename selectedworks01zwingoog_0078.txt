Europe, as, to mention their names, the Bohemians, Picards‚ who
were led astray by such heretics as Wyclii and Hus, living contrary
to the decrees and ordinances ο1 the holy popes, acting contrary to
the regulations ο1 the Christian Church and not putting any laith
in the intercession ol the saints, or still less in purgatory. And

must have been misled and ruled in error, which it were un-
christian to believe, I do not need to say. Novis the interces-
