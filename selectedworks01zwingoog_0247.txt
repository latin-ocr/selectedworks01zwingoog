had at first been unwisely begun. He knew that man would
perish as he did by his own fault, and he had prepared the
'healing by Jesus, that is, the Saviour, before man gave himself
the seli-inflicted wound. God therefore made no other covenant
with the miserable race of man than that he had already con-
ceived before man was formed. One and the same testament
has always been in force. There is ever one and the same un·
changeable God, one only Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of God
not by adoption, but by nature, God eternal and blessed for

furnished salvation through Jesus Christ. By him alone is access
to the F ather, so Abraham even came to God by no other way

alone is access to God. Therefore there is one only testament,
for the covenant with God tends only that we may have eternal
peace and joy.

Yet before I come to conclusion I wish to reply to a question
which is perhaps not so fine spun as it appears. What difference
is there between the Old and the New Testamenti Very much

spoints which concern God and us; very much if you regard what
concerns us alone. The surn is here: God is our God ς we are
his people. In these there is the least, in fact, no difference.
The chief thing is the same to-day as it ever was. For just as
¹Abraham embraced Jesus his blessed seed, and through him was
saved, so also today we are saved through him. But so far as
human infirmlty is concerned‚ many things carne to them ina
ligure to instruct them and be a testimony to us. These are
therefore the things which seem to distinguish the Old Testament
from the New, while in the thing itself or in what pertains to
the chief thing they differ not at all. First‚ Christ is now given,
whom formerly they awaited with great desire. Simeon is a

witness. Second, they who died then in faith did not ascend
