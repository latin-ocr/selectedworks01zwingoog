not discuss these matters, speak and decide the truth. To the
remark that the other nations would not consent, 1 answer that this
is just the complaint which is made every day conceming the “ big
moguls ” (grossen Hansen, literally “big Jacks)‚ bishops and
priests, that they undertake to keep the pure and clear Gospel‚
the Holy Scriptures, from the common people. For they say that

moguls’will allow no council in which the divine Scriptureswere set
forth in their cleamess and purity. It is also plain that nothing
vill come ol it this year, however much the common Christian
eamestly did toward it, because sufficient supplies could not be
