REFUTA'I'ION OF Barrrst mens. · 241

Zwingli asserta, that the Hebrews' infants were of the people and
church of God.’' To which I think I rnay now the more advan-
tageously answer, inasmuch as I have said these few things about
election and predestination, in about the following manner: It
is sure that with God no one is of his people or of his sons except
he whom he has elected, and it is also sure that every one is his
whom he has elected. But in this way, 0 Catabaptists‚ all your
foundation has fallen away. For not only believers (as you
would understand “ believers '’ in actuality) are the sons of God,
’ but those who are elect are' sons even before they believe, just
as you yourselves prove by the example of Jacob.

What then shall we do with the saying: Who believeth not
shall be condemned? For infanta do not believe, they will then
be condemned. Again, the elect were chosen before they were
conceived; they ¹are at once then sons of God, even if they die
before they believe orare called to faith. You see the chain
and order! Faith is in that order the last thing beyond glorifi-
cation, therefore what precedes it is no less certain than faith
itself. For as it is true “ he believes, therefore is saved,” so it
is not less true that “ he is called, therefore is saved.’' (I am
not speaking here oi that calling of which Christ said: Many are
called but few chosen. For there he means the external calling,
by which many are invited by the preaching of the word. Now
I mean that internal calling which Christ calls “drawing.’') It
is equally true: He is predestined, therefore saved, and he is
elect, therefore saved. Do you not ree that whatever is in this
chain and precedes faith is equally with faith followed by salva-
tion? For “ Who is elect shall be saved ” is as true as “ Who
hath believed shall be saved.'' On the other hand, equal infer-
ences cannot be drawn by arguing from the prior matters to faith
unless we accept faith otherwise than for that fact and certitudo
of mind which regards the invisible things, about which later.
For it does not follow “He is elect, therefore believes.” For
Jacob was elect when he had not yet believed. Nor does this
