ing that such right may be extended to them, then they shall be
accepted ior the sake of especial friendship and they shall be
treated with regard to this law in every way as our own, but we
shall not otherwise burden ourselves with any one dwelling out-
side oi the territories oi the city of Zu1ich.

And in order that such legal business may be attended to
promptly, as necessity demands, we have chosen as judges six
men, two from the peopleâ€™s priests in our city, who are taught
in the Word oi God, also two from the small, and two from the

large council. Among these, each one shall serve two months as '

magistrate or judge, shall summon, order, collect, examine,
practice and execute such court business as necessity demands
Whatever they pronounce and judge, according to the contents

oi the following articles and ordinances shall stand. If, how-
ever, any of our people, or others, wish to appeal, it shall be made
to no other body than the Honorable Council in our city oi

Zurich.

The court days are, and shall be, on Monday and Thursday.
The seat or place ot the court the judge shall choose and
announce. Accordingly, when it has struck one o'cloclr in the
aftemoon, then the judges, secretary, the court beadle, and who-
ever serves the court, shall be there, on pain ot breaking their
ooth, and shall assist in the action, as is proper. But ii any one
cannot be there on account ot business oi the city, or other law-
iul cause, then the burgomaster shall, by means of the beadle,
appoint another, and let him sit. And whoever is judge at a
time shall have possession oi the seal ot the court, and shall,
through the beadle, announce orally or by other notice the
sessions and orders, always in good time. The cases which
come before him, and which need consideration or deliberation,
he shall not postpone or hold up inore than a week, so that the
people may be joined or separated promptly.
