that they who trust him will never die or will ever live rnost
joyously. For that “ last day ’' here is not so much that final
day ol all things of the present world as the linai day of each
when he leaves this world. This is easily understood from John
v. ²⁴² He cometh not into judgment, but hath passed from
death unto liie. In 1 Cor. xv. the apostle, speaking of the resur-
rection, makes this which is understood as continuance or per-
sistence in life, so to spealr superior, ol which he speaks in
general, until he comes to the passage: How do the dead rise,
or with what body do they come? There finally he reaches the
discussion of that resurrection of the llesh which is to come at
length. Do you, reader, that you may see that I assert nothing

Paul or us (it was a ioolish thing which followed the faithful out
oi uubeliei even unto belief, for some things cliug which per-
versely have the appearance of piety, especially toward parents
aud relatives). But the apostle acutely employed the ioolish
abuse of bapitism—which in my judgment was nothing else thau
the spriukliug with lustral water the graves of their dead, as
sorus do to-day-against those who deuied that the soul lived
after it left the body until it was raised for judgment. And he
thus catches them: If then the soul sleeps, why do you, too,
moisten with lustral water the graves of the dead? What benefit

do you do those who do nol live, but are either nothing or
