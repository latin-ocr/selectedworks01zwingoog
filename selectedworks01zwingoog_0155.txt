the affirmative, as the apostles baptized adulta and believers,
therefore infante are not to be baptized. You may argue neither
in divine nor in secular matters from the fact to the right 3 then
only may a fact be adduced for the law when an act has been

proved done by the law. For example, at Zurich it was per· ,

mitted by the goodness of God to abolish all externals without
compromising public peace. Since this was done legally itis
not lawful to do away with all at Winterthur and Stein if only
love as a judge permits it as right. At Jerusalem things strangled
and blood were interdicted because of the weak. Now at Bern
and Basel certain things which are not most wicked can be borne
to acertain extent if love warns that this is right 3 impious things,
such as the mass, idols, false doctrine, are not to be suffered.
Therefore the acts of the apostles are to be a law to us so far as
they were done under sanction of the law. So it is only things
false and wicked that right forbids both them and us to do, spart
from whether they themselves have ever done them. For when
you have done that which was permissible you have done right,
even though no apostle had done it. My words therefore must
be understood as dealing with right arrd with fact. To wit,
infante may not be denied baptism because it is nowhere ex-
pressly said that the apostles baptized infante. Also there is the
consideration that, as we shall show clearly, the fact that they
baptized may not have been put down in writing, and the acts
of none may prejudice the right, much less acts not committed.
So that if it were down in plain words somewhere: ΤῙιε apostles
did not baptize infante, it would not (even then) follow that they
are not to be baptized. The inquiry would have to be made
whether they simply omitted the performance or whether it was
not right to baptize. This we prove by John iv, where you read:
Although Jesus himself did not baptize. Here you have an
example of fact or non-fact. Christ did not baptize ; must we

therefore, according to you, not baptize? This would followif
you are to argue from a fact to alaw. And you can not say:
