Grace undertoolr to come to the meeting upon the day appointed
by the burgomaster and the Council oi the city oi Zurich con-
cerning the dissension and trouble which had arisen in the city
on account ot doctrines or sermons, but from business reasons
and other accidental causes you were detained and hindered
from attending. And although in addition to all the clergymen,

its territories there were invited and summoned to this praise-

than were spoken in the assembly. I write and send this to
Your Grace, and beg Your Grace to accept it with good will and
lavor as a service. I also urgeas a tellow brother in Christ
Your Grace to remain in the future as in the past steadiastly by
