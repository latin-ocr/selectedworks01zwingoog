Thereiore as iar as concems this mandate I do not desire to
speak further. But since the good, pious gentleman (Ι don’t
know where he sits, because Ι cannot see him,) has referred
to the priest imprisoned at Constance my office requires meto
make answer. liou all know, dear sire, how this priest was turned
over to my gracious Lord of Constance hythe common peers
[lit. confederates: citizens oi the Consederacy] in the diet at

Baden as a guilty man. Accordingly my gracious Iord had the
prisoner examined and questioned by appointees oi his Gracc,
and the prisoner was found to he an ignorant and erring man in

the divine Scriptures,and1mysell have often pitied his unskilliul .

remarks. For by my faith I can say that I questioned him
myseli, went to him in Christian love, set forth to him some oi
the Scriptures from St. Paul, and he made-what shall I say?-
very inaccurate answers. Ah, my dear sirs, what shall I say about
this good, simple fellow? He is really untutored, and is not
even a grammarian* For in Christian brotherly love, kindly and
without any anger, Ι mentioned to him some Scriptures, as ior
instance, that the noble Paul exhorted Timothy, saying: Pietas
ad omnia utilis (kindness and greatness are good in all things),
and his answer was so childish and unchristian as to be improper
to mention and report in the Consederation. But that you may
really know, my dear sirs, I spoke with him about praying to the
dear saints and to the mother oi God, also about their intercession,
and I found him so ignorant and unchristian on these points
that I pity his error. He insists on making living out oi the
dead, although the Scriptures show that also heiore the birth oi

’ Christ the dear saints were prayed to and called upon ior others,

as I finally convinced and persuaded him by means of Scriptures,
that is, by Genesis Exodus, Ezechiel and Bamch. I also brought
matters so far that he recanted his error, and desires to recant

all his errors about the mother of God and the dear saints. I
also hope that he will be grateful to me and soon be released.
