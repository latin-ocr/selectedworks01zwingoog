deeds, adultery, parricide, perjury, theit, evil, guile, and about all
crimes there are anywhere, are more common than among those
whom they call tor contumely “the flesh and the devil.” Ι tell
the truth, Ι lie not; there is none ot these that Icannot
abundantly prove it the occasion demands)-In whatsoever sin
they are taken, Ι say, they escape in no other way thau: Ι have
not sinned, lor I arn no longer in the flesh, but in the spirit 3 Ι
am dead to the flesh, and the flesh ¹to me. Do they not betray

this class of men we must be on constant watch, all our forces
and machines must be brought, my brethren, and the more
