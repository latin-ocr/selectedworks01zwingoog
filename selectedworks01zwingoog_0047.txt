mon which God had purified, we may boldly declare that itis
not right ior any man to declare that that is not lawiul which
God has suffered to be lawiul. For iipin that which is ol little
account God was unwilling to accept the judgment oi Peter, how
much less in a matter oi much greater moment will he accept
the judgment ol one interior to Peter? Our feeling on this point
is clear enough irom what has gone before, when we add that
the words oi Christ on the subject we are speaking of arethe

they cannot contain, let thern marry: for it is better to marry
than to bum.” Therefore it one cannot contain one's seli, it
one burns, let him marry. We have been so on fire irom passion
