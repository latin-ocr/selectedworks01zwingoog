as the boldness of the calumniator suggests, recognize that the
following is your syllogism, or rather paralogiam: The apostles
are not said to have baptized infants, therefore they did not, and
these are not to be baptized. So that we are compelled to turn
your weapons against yourselves. This is probably what led the
apostles to think that the gospel was not to be preached to the
Gentiles. In the first mission this interdict was given: Go ye
not into the way of the Gentiles, from which it was possible for
them to assert most strongly that it was. intended by Christ that

heard the word of the Lord, and so he was baptized, and all who
were in his house, they, too, heard and so were baptized.
Where again infants are excluded, for they could not hear and
