lore according to the Catabaptists' iaith they were not sons oi
Abraham. therefore they believed who were destined ior this
by God when age allowed it and they were oi the people oi God,
those who were circumcised grew and advauced until they at-
tained intelligence and belief, and meanwhile they were oi the
people ol God. Not only believers then are oi the church and
people oi God, but their children. And when the Catabaptists
admit that sons ol Abraham according to the flesh were within

they are counted within. the church and people oi Christ, ought
in no way to be deprived oi baptism, the sign oi the covenant, and
the arguments oi the Catabaptists which because oi their ignorance
oi figures and tropes they think valid, areos no avail against us.

And we shall not on account oi our ignorance compel the Holy r

Spirit to lay aside its own method oi speaking. He has always

spoken to the whole chureh some things which did not fit a ¹
great part, but that part was not on this account cast out oi the ¹

church, out oi the people, out oi the coveuaut oi God. And
the iact that the sacraments, so lar as pertains to externals is
