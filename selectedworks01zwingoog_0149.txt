they wandered through the country by night and infested all to
the best ol their opportunity. After that conference (the tenth,
with the others public or private) the senate decreed that he
should be drowned who rebaptiaed another. Perhaps Ι obtrude
these details upon you to your great disgust‚ good reader; but it
is not heat or bias that has influenced me, only a faithful watch-
