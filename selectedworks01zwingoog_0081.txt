past by the fathers in council assembled which were afterward
repealed and revohed by others who thought they assembled in
the spirit oi God, as is plainly· found in the Nicene Council
and that oi Gangre· in the first oi which the clergy was
allowed to marry, and all those who spolie against it were cursed‚
while the second decided upon the opposite.† It is alst a iact
that many times ordinances (constitutiones) have been issued

*[Held in the 4tb century. Gangra was the capital oi ten Asia Minor
provinces oi Paphlagonia]

†[“ ‘Not a word is written conceming this in the canons oi the council ol
Nicaeass To be sure Zwingli said that Paphnutius in tbe council ol Nicaea had
been, bywbich Zwingli means' that marriage at that time (although he partly errs)
was permitted. Now in tbe council oi Gangra you say in your report Zwingli had
' said it had been iorbidden. How could you lose your memoryinsuch iashion
that you could write such? On the contrary he said that it had been permitted in
thecounciloiGangra,anddoubtlesslyhebasedtbisuponanotherpamphlet,wbicb
he called ‘Apologeticum,' and written in Latin quatering (see Latin version).
Rogo nunc ut concilio parendum, etc. You do him wrong, now 1 must lake his
part. Furthermore beware‚ my pamphlet here will be read the sooner by those
who are at Zilrich and accepted as good. Zwingli also bas referred to the

, Carthaginian council. ln the first place 1 sbowerl how there are two kinds ol

councils, namely‚ those oi the general Christianity, which are called ‘oecu-
menica' or ‘universalia' in Greek and Latin; then the ‘particularia' Now
it is never lound that in the matter oi iaith the ‘universalia’ were ever opposed
to each other. The Carthaginien council was onlyaspecial one. And to
every bishop was leit his lree will and opinion; and only later the council ol
Nicaea was held by 318 Fathers‚ (thus) they may have had an honest excuse.
Why have you omitted this report?” (Faber.) Heinrich Wolf answered
thereupon: “Zwingli simply said that in a council Paphnutius with difficulty
had secured permission ior the marriage oi the priests, also spolie well against
such statutes. Now you come iorward and say that be placed Paphnutius in
the Nicaean council‚ although he said to·day (as 1 asked him about it) that he
had never read about a council which bad forbidden marriage, but about popes
500 years aiter the birth oi Christ. But since the papists spealr so consistently
about the Nicaean council he made bis point, bow he really had never read
careiully the history oi this council, and thus had believed you papists. And
you have brought lorth the Nicaean council, and not Zwingli; then you opposed
the Gangrensian council by saying that it was not a general one.” (⁶¹Gyren·
