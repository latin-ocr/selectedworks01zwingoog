so noble a racc as would have been 11 he had not betrayed his
trust. So then it came about, that such as the offspring was, it
was disseminated, as the cultivator, in all the corners oi the earth.
But, however, it grew and multiplied, and became divided into
the various races 01 men, yet divine Providence in a peculiar way
designated one to be among all peoples as especially sacred, as
11 it were a venerabie priesthood among all. Divine Providence
selected this race ior this purpose, that when it would clear the
world’s sin by the death 01 bis Son, this Son should take a body
in which he could die 110111 this nation. And this nation he
followed in all times with his· great blessings, nay, he so cherishcd
and preserved it in every crisis that hy observation 01 this alone

arose and killed his brother, who merited and expected no such
thing. So all leli out that everything depended upon one; Abel

’ his conscience that out 01 him should not arise the one who was

to repair the 1011 01 his parents. But God in his goodness suc·
cored them in this calamity, and hc sent them another son, asa

*The name is commonly interpreted ‘¹ acquisition.''

†Modern scholars made the name “Abel ” mean ‘⁸ breath” or “ vanity.”
