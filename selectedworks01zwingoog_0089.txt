tion that in future no one would be consecrated who would not
pledge himself to remain unmarried and chaste. Thus also it
was resolved in the council at Carthage that no bishop, priest or
deacon should have intercourse with women, but remaiu chaste
without wife. Hence I say that it will be no easy matter to
show that marriage was ever permitted to priests*

And even if you say since the time of the apostles, still mar·

maniage of priests? On account ot this l have kept quiet and have omitted
to state a better reason. But where bave you hidden the fact that l said that
from the time ol the apostles one does not read that one who was consecrated
as subdeacon, deacon, priest or bishop could marry again aher his wife
had died? Did 1 not say further that it is thus understood, not alone in the
Western, but also in the Eastem Church—in Crete, Corcyra, etc.‚ also in ludia,
in the case of the Presbyter John, and among the Russiaus? so that any one who
tools ι virgin as wile may be consecrated as priest, but that if she die that he
can take no more; in the same manner it he bas no wile before he is conse·
crated be can talre none alter the consecratione this l have shown. Why do
you omit this? It was indeed necessary for you to include the subtile,
honorable interruption of one who spoke about the prostitutes; and you
also placed Gurschenkelt as a character in the comedy. Since the good
Master Ulricb consoles himself much in his speeches and writings with a
text which he found in XXVII. dist. c.‚ ‘Si quis discemit‚' which is claimed
to have been made in Gangrensian council‚'l‹now then that there were not
more than 16 bishops in that coun'cilr these made 19 canons against the
majority that even desired to abolish holy marriage. But therein they did not
reiect the state of virginity and widowhood, hence also the marriage of priests
was not, as you think, admitted by the pious Fathers. They spoke about the
priests who had wives before the consecration—and berhink yourselt what
couneils over 18 bishops would prefer, even although they should preterit
were so, as it is not, as Zwingli says. Now see how the supplication issued by
your and our common gracious lord of Constance shall be answered. About
the marriage of priests 1 do not like to spealr (several times repeated). Accu·
sations ol two wrong quotations were made.” (Faber.)]
