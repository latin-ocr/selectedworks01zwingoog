How is it that God is not to be insoked when the salety ola
neighbor is in danger? An oath is therefore adivine thing,a

⁴ sacred anchor to which we dee when human wisdom can go no

larther. For who knows what is in man except God alone? He
therefore betrays him who swears falsely by him. For a man
is believed ior the luith and religious tnrst which he has in God
to have spoken [tnrly] and to be ready to luitill. And it is through
him that he deceivea For the benefit, then, ol one's neighbor
an oath is commanded by God. And since the whole law and
the prophete hang upon these two commands: Thnn shalt love
the Iord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy
mind, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyasis, then the oath
itrett is an appeal to God, whom you uniquely love and serve,
and is lor the advantage ol the neighbor. Who then will dare
against all the authority oi Scripture to deprive the people ol God
ol the oath? God cannot be offended by an nath, lor he is
called as a witness, so that it we are not believed yet we may be
believed, since we will on no account betray him. For all will
be praised who shall swear by him. And the neighbor also will

not be hurt, lor the oath is given lor his advantage, that he may ¹

either know that to be true which he did not know, or may be
sure that what he deprecatae will not be done by his neighbor or
what he asks will be granted. So lar from a devout man not

being able to take an oath, he will be impious who refuses when ³

a matter worthy this attestation demands.
But the whole source ol the error arises from their not seeing
the opinion ol Christ in Matt. v. 333 indeed they do not know

the very words. For the German word “ schwdren‚” to which they l

suppose the Greek ἐπιορκεῖν, the Latin “jurare” is similar, has
another signification than what they suppose. For when we say
in German “ Der schwdrt‚’' i. c.‚ he susara, it is uncertain whether
aformal oath is referred to or whether one is just swearing off·
hand. The signification of this word is twolold. The Latin “ jurare”
is always used in a good sense, i. e., tor asking a sacred obligation.
