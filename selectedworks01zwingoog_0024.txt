THE EPISCOPAL VISl’l'ATION· 11

of us, should be wamed not to be present. For nothing was
going to be said in reply to our friends, no one could contradict
so sound aspeech, and so on. When I discovered this,I devoted
all my energy to getting us admitted to the meeting of the Senate
to be held on the following day. For a long time I tunred every
stone in vain, for the chief men of the Senate said it could not
be done, inasmuch as the Senatc had voted otherwise. ¹Then l
began to cease my efforts and to plead with sighs to him who
heareth the groans of those in bondage not to abandon the truth,
. but to come to the defense of his gospel, which he had willed to
have us preach. At length on the ninth the citizens assembled,
aud loudly vented their indignation at their bishops not being
admitted, but they of the Senate which from its number is called
the Less resisted because they had voted otherwise previously.
The Greater Senate, however, compelled them against their will
to put the matter to vote, and it was decided that their bishops
should be present and hear everything, and if need be make
answer. Thus, not, as Livy says, did the greater part prevail
over the better; for here both the greater and the better part
prevailed. And this I have allowed myself to write, not for the
sake of laying any blame upon the Lesser Senate, but to show
what plotting and underhand action can accomplish. For what
else were the delegates of the Bishop of constance after but to
say without witnesses whatever came into their mouths before
the simple minded commons? Thanlrs be to God. For when the
delegatas were brought into the Senate, we bishops of Zurich were
also admitted, Heury Engelhard, LL.D., of the nunnery, Rudolph
Rdschlin, bishop of St. Peter's, and I, Huldreich Zwingli. *¹ Then

He died in 1551, avery old man. Rudolph Roschlin, people's priest at St.
Peter's, was very slow ln accepting the Reformation, was at the time of this
episcopal visit an old man, and a few weeks after it resigned his place and was
succeeded by Zwingli’s bosom friend, Leo Jud.
