supper of the Lord? But while you see this most clearly, do
they not do this same thing under the action of the law of excom-
munication or banning that immediately precedes? Therefore
whither reaches the treatment of one and the same cause under
two constitutions? You infer therefore with no trouble that by
this principle they wish-no matter what string of words they
put together-that he who would come with thern to the table of
the Lord must also be rebaptized in their catabaptism, and that
they who were baptized as infants these men consider to be of

they see those things done among us which Christ himself did
not abhor, they traduce, curse and condemn. And on the other

hand, how sincerely they act when they think of themselves so
finely that they boast that they are the people who have been

called to God from the world. As if indeed lewdness, adultery,
murder, hatred, enry, arrogance, hypocrisy—in which these people
excel-all mortals were not worldly. I am not speaking of the irn-
moderate expense, voluptuousness and wantonnessof marriagesand
feasts, but Ι am so far from condemning joy in moderation that l
think he who takes it away from the pious will have to restore it
with interest. In a word, by this law they mean that no one shall
