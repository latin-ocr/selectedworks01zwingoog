, PREFACE.

Trrrs volume presents a selection from the contente ot the
eight volumes in which the works ol Huldreich Zwingli, the
Reformer ot German Switzerland, are preserved in the only
edition now accessible, namely, that published in Zurich between
1828 and 1842, witha supplement in 1861. Egli and Finsler’s
edition in the Corpus Reformatorum is announced but will not
be finished ior at least ten years. The selection has been made
purposely trorn those papers which had never been translated
-at least not in their entirety—into modern German or English.
These papers have been arranged in chronological order, and
when read consecutively present a documentary history ol several
phases ot the Zurich Reformation. They have been utilized
in my biography ot Zwingli, published by G. P. Putnam's Sons,
New York city, in the series ol “ Heroes ot the Reformation,¹'
and are here printed in tull by the courtesy ot the publishers ot
the series. As appears, the translations from the Latin were
made by Mr. Henry Preble‚ of this city, and by Prof. George
W. Gilmore‚ and those from the Zurich German by Mr. Law-
rence A. Melouth, Professor of German in the New York
University. They will be found accurate and spirited, and Ι am
very proud to be able to put into the hands ol the English
reader for the first time matter of so interesting and important a
character. My highest ambition is that Huldreich Zwingli may
win in this wayalarge number ot friends. My own part in this new

” 'volume is avery modest one. Ihave made the selectione, sup·

plied some introductory matter, and a few notes. Those who
would lilre to read more ot the writings ot Zwingli Ι refer to
