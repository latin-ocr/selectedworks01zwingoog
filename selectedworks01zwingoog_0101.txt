After this Dr. Sebastiam* from Schallhausen, a member of the
order of the Barefoot Monks, arose and began to admonish the
assembled council that they should manage and protect the
evangelical doctrine as until now, since there was no one there
who could bring forward, upon frequent requests, anything more
definite from the Scriptores. But he could not finish; the vicar
interrupted and said:

Dr. Sebastian, you should keep still and not speak thus. You
know well what you promised my gracious master; it does not
behoove a man to be so vacillating, to be moved like a reed by
the wind3 you had not promised that before.

Answered the aforesaid Dr. Sebastian: Dear gentlemen, what
I have promised the bishop that 1 have faithfully and honorably
kept, but his people have not rulfilled and carried out what they
promised to me3 that you may testify what I have said here in
public.

After this speech there arose another doctor, lector and
preaeher from Bern, of the order of the Barefoot Monks,† and
admonished the wise council of Zurich, speaking as follows:

Honorable, eareful, wise, gracious, favorable gentlemen of
Zurich, your intention and opinion, published in all places by
means oi open letter for the aid of the Gospel, pleases me well,
and praised be God that you are the people to further and not
to obstruet the word oi God, and pray God that He will not turn
away and cause your wisdom to desert from such a godly under· -
