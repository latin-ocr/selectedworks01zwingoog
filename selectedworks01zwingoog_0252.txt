ior this. Paul proceeds: Whom he predestined he also called
Here before calling we have predestination or marking out.
Whom he called he also justzfied. But are we not justified by
raith? Yes, but calling precedes saith. For Christ wams also
that no one can come to him unless the Father have drawn him.
To draw and to call are here equivalents. But whom he justified
he also glorified, for they who believe are etemally honored with
him in whom they have believed. Here then is the knut-How
does saith bless or how justiiy? We see that the first thing ia
God’s deliberation or purpose or election, second his predestina-
tion or marking out, third his calling, lourth justification. Since
then all these are of God, and taith hardly holds the fourth
place, how is it that we say that salvation comes ol faith, since
wherever laith is there also is justification, or rather, each person's
salvation has before been so determined and loreordained with
God that it is impossible that one so elected can be condemned?
But bya light bluw ol synecdoche ¹* what seems insoluble dissolves·
For faith is used ior the election oi God, the predestination or
calling, which all precede saith, but in the same order. Soit you
say: God’s election, ¹predestination or marking out, calling,
beatifies, you will ever say right. Why? Because the harmoni-
ous order and connections of these are such that you may use
one of these without the other and yet not exclude the others 3
especially is this the case when you take faith, which is inferior
and posterior to election, predestination or calling. Since then
the justification which is ol laith closely follows calling, we see
with no trouble that salvation is attributed to faith because they
who have faith are called, elected and foreordained.

But why is salvation attributed to saith above the others?
Why does Paul use this linkout of the chain? I reply, because

*This rhetorical ligure wherein the part is put lor the whole, or a whole lor
a part, is considered by Zwingli an unanswerable argument. Instances ol it
are frequent. E. g„ the Athenians are olten spoken ol as il they comprised
all the Greeks, aud what they did the Greeks are said to have done.
