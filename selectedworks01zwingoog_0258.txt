contrariwise, since I have the indubitable word oi promise: They
shall come and sit down with the God oi Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob,l shall be impious il I eject them from the company ol
the people oi God. What then ol Esau it he had died as an in7
lant? Would your judgment place him among the elect? Yes.
Then does election remain sure? It does And reiection re·
mains also. But listen. Il Esau had died an infant he would
doubtless have been ol the elect. For il he had died then there
would have been the seal ol election‚ for the Lord would not
have rejected him eternally. But since he lived and was oi the
nonnelect he so lived that we see in the fruit ol his unfaith that
he was rejected by the iord. All our error arises from this, that
while we hardly leam all even irom the seqnel we break in also
upon providence. This disposes all, so that not only Esau, but
not even a root in the sea, not a weed in the garden or a gnat

Esau was or why a gnat has so sharpa sting * we can hardly leam

mind of Esau that he was rejected of God, in vain do we say:
Would that he had died an iniant! He could not die whom
divine Providence had created that he might live, and live wick-

Scripture arises irom‘onr ignorance ol Providence. But I retum
to my subject. Manifest then from all that precedes are those
two inferences. That those two sayings: Who believeth, etc,
and Who believeth not, etc„ are not a touch-stone hy which we
may measure the salvation ol infanta and that we condemn im·
piously not only the true children ol Christians, but those oi
Gentiles. They alone are subject to our judgment oi whom we
have the word according to which we can judge. I think I have
also satisfied those who say: 1r by election we corne to God
Christ is in vain. For this is election‚ that whom the Lord has
destined to etemal salvation before the world was, he equally
