demon and the Roman pontiti. We met this attack at once,
promised an amicable conference. It was appointed ior Tuesday
oi each week. At the first meeting the battle was sharp but
without abuse, as we especially took in good part their insults.
Let God be the witness and those who were present, as well from
their side as from ours. ΤΙιε second was sharper. Some ol
them, since they could do nothing with scripture, carried on the
affair with open abuse. When they saw themselves beaten aiter
a considerable conflict, and when we had exhorted them in
friendly ways, we brolre up in such a way that many oi them
promised they would make no disturbance, though they did not
promise to give up their opinions. Within three, or at most four,
days it was announced that the leaders ot the sect had baptized
fitteen brethren. Then we began to perceive why they had deter-
mined to collect a new church and had opposed iniant baptism
so seriously. We warned the church that it could not be main-
tained, that this proceeded from good counsel, to say nothing of
a good spirit, and for these reasons: They had attempted a
division and partition oi the church, and this was just as hypo-
critical as the superstition ol the monks. Secondly, though the
churches had to preserve their liberty oi jud'ging concerning
doctrine, they had set up catabaptism without any conierence,
lor during the whole battle about inlant baptism they had said
nothing about catabaptism. Third, this catabaptism seemed
lilre the watchword oi seditious men. Then when they learned
this in great swarms they came into the city, unbelted and girded
with rope or osiers, and prophesied, as‘they called it, in the
marlret place and squares. They filled the air with their eries

about the old dragon, as they called me, and his heads, as they
called the other ministers oi the word. They also commended
their justice and innocence to all, for they were about to depart.
They boasted that already they hold all things in common, and
threatened with extremes others unless they do the same. They
went through the streets with portentous uproar, crying Woe!
