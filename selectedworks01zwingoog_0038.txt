11. ΡΕΤΙΤΙΟΝ OF CERTAIN PREACHERS OF SWITZER·
LAND TO THE MOST REVEREND LORD HUGO,
BISHOP OF CONSTANCE, THAT HE WILL NOT SUF FER
HIMSELF TO BE PERSUADED TO MAKE ANY PROC-
LAMATION TO THE INJURY OF THE GOSPEL, NOR
ENDURE LONGER THE SCANDAL OF HARLOTRY,
BUT ALLOW THE PRESBYTERS TO MARRY WIVES OR
AT LEAST WOULD WINK AT THEIR MARRIAGEs.*

To the Most Reverend-F'a-ther and [ord in Christ, Hugo oi
Hohenlandenberg, Bishop of Constance, the undersigned offer

obedient greeting.

Your Excellency will perhaps wonder, Most Reverend Father,
what this unusual action ol writing a letter to yoursett means,
and not without reason. For nature has ordained that the un·
expected should create not only wonder, hut at times evena
feeling ot dumfoundedness. Yet we would have you to he
entirely free and undisturbed in regard to this matter which we
are laying before you. For we do not come to your Excellency
in regard to anything very troublesonre, but to find help. For
we are so sure that you are both a most pious lord and a most
loving father that there is nothing we do not promise ourselves

*Zwingli's Works, iii. 17-25. Translated by Mr. Henry Pteble luem the
original Latin.

This paper explains itseli. The revelation it makes is curious. The signers
had doubtless desire to preach the gospel as they understood it; but they had
a much greater desire to be legally married. They must have known that their
bishop had no authority to grant their requests. It should be remarlred that
when Zwingli and his 10 associates drew up the paper here given they were
priests in good and regular standing, and had no idea ol leaving the church.
Their statements are to be believed. This trent, not to say naive, petition
stands against all denials ol the nnchastity ol most oi the Swiss clergy. Simul·
taneously with its issuance Zwingli issued another, written in German (see his
Works, i. 30-51), addressed to the government oi the Conlederacy‚ which also
was a plea lor the iree course ol the gospel, but particularly that it the bishop
should allow the priests to marry the government would allow it and ’ proteat
the married priests.
