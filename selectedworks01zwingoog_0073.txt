further, and Iwould like to have judgment as to how I should

⁴ [Faber accuses Hegenwald oi error in the order ot bis speeches.

“llou note me down as il 1 had made the tourth speech, and bring iorth
a speech oi which tnrly 1 would be ashamed, provided 1 could not erase it by
means ot the Scriptures better by the grace oi God. You have noted me down
as ii 1 bad immediately broken torth atter the speech ot Zwingli, which you
know is not true. For 1 learnt long ago irom Roman histories that an ambas·
sador should not exceed his authority. This 1 have not torgotten, that one
should not preach unless he be sent. 'lbereiore since 1 have not been sent by
my gracious lord as a combatant, but as a spectator, yea as a peaceiul umpire,
Ι did not wish to answer the many speeches and demands; also partly exhor-
tation oi Zwingli. And where there had been along silence, you know that
Mr. Ulrich having dared to name several, requested us lrom Constance urgently,
still 1 maintained silence until the 'priest (whom you call), v. Mittenbach (Nei-
tenbach), referred to my gracious lord and myseli so much and so clearly that
1 thought, and 1 also said it to the mighty lord Fritz Jacob v. Anwyl, that 1
could not leave that unanswered. For although you closed the speech accord·
ing to your wont, still you omit that the priest says among other things that the
bishop ot Constante had lorbidden to preach the Gospel—write what the Vicar
there said—then you will find that Ι said before, Iam not here to suppress the

had brought and proclaimed to the shepherds upon the pasture when Christ
was bom the consoling message that in the Gospel was the salvation, yea the
way and the truth, in comparing the New and Old Testament; also the ionrevan·
gelists are the tour rivers oi Paradise, which malre imitiul the whole world with
the water oi divine greces it has been arranged with better order, as St. Paul
says, and Ι also have helped in it, since my ‘scholastici doctores' have been
diligently read and underscored by me, so that they also have become dirty
lrom my hands. Thus Ι have also seen that it would be better and more
wholesome to leave sophistry and to bring iorward the Gospel and the prophets
and also other divine writings. Therelore Ι held to the first proposition, how
this might happen and the Gospel be brought torth, which then is true even ii
Master Ulrich Zwingli had never come to Ztlrich. But 1 was not thus minded,
and did not help to arrange the proposition so that the Gospel should be
preacbed in a revolutionary manner, but according to the essential Christian
and peaceiul understanding. And iurthermore 1 declared the Gospel does not
consist in reading, but in the strength oi God, yea in the correct interpretation
and understanding, and Ι have proved by two places in the Gospel oi Matthew,
Matt. iv. 6, where the tempter cites the saying Ps. ac. From this Ι have shown
