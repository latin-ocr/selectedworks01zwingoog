Catabapatts. Third. In the breaking oi bread we thus agree
and unitedly determine that they who wish to break one bread in

ἶ commemoration oi the broken body oi Christ, and to drink oi
ζ one cup in commemoration oi his shed blood, shall first come
’ together into one body oi Christ, that is the church oi God, in

¹ wurcn curra rs tue head. und tus rs particularly through bap-

* tism. For,as the divine Paul teaches, we cannot be at the same

Ι time participants ot the Lord's table and the demons', nor can

ζ we be participante at the same time oi the Lord's cup and the
f devils'. I. e.‚ all who have communion with the dead works of

the shades have no communion with those who are called from

justly called pseudo· or catabaptism (some preter “anabap-

Christ's church and against the divine law, by your baptism you
crucily Christ again (tor as he was once dead and once was
raised hom the dead, so he desires to have once baptiaed him
who loves Christ) ; you do not dare to call your rebaptism cata·
