The articles and opinions below, 1,Ulricthing1i, confess to
have preached in the worthy city of Zurich as based upon the
Scriptures which are called inspired by God, and I offer to
protect and conquer with the said articles, and where Ι have not

now correctly understood said Scriptures I shall allow myseli to
be taught better, but only from said Scriptores.

1. All who say that the Gospel is invalid without the confirma-
tion οἱ the Church errand slander God.

Il. The sum and substance of the Gospel is that our Iord
Jesus Christ, the true Son oi God, has made known to us the

will oi his heavenly F ather, and has with his innocense released
us from death and reconciled God.

III. Hence Christ is the only way to salvation ior all who ever
were, are aud shall be.

IV. Who seelis or points out another door errs, yea, he is a
murderer oi souls and a thief.

V. Hence all who consider other teachings equal to or higher
than the Gospel err, and do not know what the Gospel is.

VI. For Jesus Christ is the guide and leader, promised by God
to all human beings which promise was iulfilled.

VII. That he isan eternal salvati0n and head oi all believers,
who are his body, but which is dead and can do nothing without
him. ⁴

VIII. From this follows srrst that all who dwell in the head
are members aud children ol God, and that is the church or
communiones the saints, the bride oi Christ, Ecclesia catholica.

IX. Furthermore, that as the members of the body can do Ι
nothing without the control oi the head, so no one in the body '
oi Christ can do the least without his head, Christ.
