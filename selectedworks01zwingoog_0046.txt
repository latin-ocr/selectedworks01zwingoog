everything in approval oi marriage. Theretore it appears to us
most true and most right that tor a Christian no third possibility
besides chastity or marriage is lett, and that he should live
chastely il that is given unto him from above, or marry a wite if
he beon fire with passion, and this we shall show nrore clearly in
a little while from the truly sacred writings. Hence we beseech
