REFUTATION OF BAPTIST TRICKS· ' 201

, not be a judge 3 it urges us not to be litigious. So also Christ
ἶ warned against lawsuits because ol the danger, since it olten
¹ occurred in lact that he who hoped to return irom the courta
³ winuer was thrown into prison till he could pay the whole debt.
But this is excessively Christian when they say: In the lawsuits
ἱ ’ which the unbelieving eugage in-meaniug by the unbelieving all
who are not oi their heretical church. For they assert that a
’ Christian may not exereise the office oi judge in external matters
-yet this is a divine matterii rightly performed. While they
³ arrogate to themselves the judgment oi the inner man (ior they

call all unbelieving who ol awhole beart cherish the true God
and the one Jesus Christ, provided these do not iollow their

⁵ erring flock). And they do this openly. For often two ol
3² them pass by good and devout men and one oi them, the other
⁵ being left to go on, stops to chat with our people3 then the one
i who has gone on, turning about, eries out to the other: Brother,

what are you doing among the unbelievers? Go away irom

Christian ought to hold office when it is appointed to him. We
reply that Christ was about to be made lring, yet he lled and
did not loolr back, according to the ordinance ol his Father.
So ought we to do, i. e., follow him„and we shall not wallr in the
darkness. For he said also: He that would follow me must
deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. He even
interdicted the power ol the sword, and thus denounced it: The
kings oi the Gentiles rule, butye are not such. So Paul says:
Whom God ioreknew he also predestinated to be conformed to
the image oi his Son. Peter also said that he had suffered, not
ruled, and leit us an example that we might follow in his foot-

steps.
