every one remained silent as to the invitation and challenge of
Master Ulrich a priest by the name of James Wagner arose,
a clergyman at Neltenbach,* and spoke as follows: Leamed,
wise, honorable‚ specially favorable, lords (gentlemeni) and
princes: Since there is no one who wishes to speak oi these
matters after the repeated summons of Master Ulrich, I must, as
the least skilllul, say something. It is well known to you all,
gentlemen, that our gracious Lord of Constance this year issued
a mandate† ordering people to retain and keep the tradr'tthnes
humanas until they were rescinded and changed by a general
council. Now since no one will say anything against Master
Ulrich’s articles, which oppose the constitutiones humanas, I say

Lords, how the clergyman ot Fislisbachl was anested according
'to the mandate, taken to Baden before the Diet, which atterwards
gave him into the keeping ol the bishop ol Constance, who finally
put him in prison. If we are to teach and preach according to
the contenta ol the mandate, then Master Ulrich’s words have no

He had announced lrom his pulpit on his return from the Zurich meeting ol
August 15, 1522, that he would no longer eall upon the Virgin Mary or the

saints. He also married. The bishop ol Constance complained against him
at the Diet ol Baden, which wished him arrested, but some lriends went surety

lor him. However, the DietinNovember, 1522, ordered his arrest. He was ,

examined in Constance, and apparently as the result ol the use ol tortore re-
canted and then was liberated.
