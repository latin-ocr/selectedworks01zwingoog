sent from Zurich, and when everybody had found a seat at the

speak as follows:

Very learned, noble, steadfast, honorable, wise, ecclesiastical
Lords and F riends: For some tirne in my Lords' city of Zurich
and her territories dissensions and quarrels have arisen on account
of certain sermons and teachings delivered to the people from
the pulpit by Master Ulrich Zwingli‚ our preacher here at Zurich,
wherefore he has been attached and blamed as a deceiver by some
and by others asa heretic. Wherefore it has corne about that
not only in our city of Zurich, but also everywhere else in the
land in my Lords’ territories such dissensions have increased

Ulrich'Zwingli has frequently offered to give the causes and
reasons for his sermons and doctrines preached here in the pub-
lic pulpit so often in Zurich in case a public discussion before all
the clergy and the laity were granted him. At this offer of

the disturbance and dissension‚ has granted him pennission to
hold a public discussion in the German language before the Great
Council at Zurich, which they call the two hundred, to which
the honorable and nise Council has summoned all of you priests
and ministers frorn her territories. It also requested the worthy
Lord and Prince, etc, Bishop of Constance‚ to send his repre-

sentative to this meeting, for which favor the honorable Council
of Zurich expresses especial thanlrs to hirn. Therefore if there

is any one here who may feel any displeasure or doubt in Master
Ulrich’s sermons or doctrines preached here at Zurich in the
pulpit, or if any one desires to say anything or knows anything to
say in the matter to the effect that such sermons and teachings
are not true, but misleading or heretical, he can prove the truth
