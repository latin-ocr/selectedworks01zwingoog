brieflyis the argument and sum of election as treated by Paul.
He says therefore, Rom. viii. 28: We know that all things work
together for good to them that love God. Now lest you should

say: Who therefore love God, or to whom are all things for '

good? he anticipates and replies: To those who according to
purpose are of the called. Do not understand this of a human
purpose, bnt of God’s, so that the sense is: Who are sanctified
of God’s purpose, ior to be called is here for to be truly sanca‘fied.
As when it is said: He shall be called the Son of the Most High.
Here shall be called is Hebrew idionr for shall truly be. 1 retum
to the argument. misyos is for Paul that freest deliberation
by which God is girded for electing, as in ix. 11 we see when he
says: That the purpose of God according to election may stand·
His purpose is therefore above election, i. a, first by nature. It
may happen among men that something is elected, but there isa
reason for its election, e. g, it is elected because it seems useful
or right. This purpose or deliberation is not free, but depends
on that which is elected. Since Paul wishes to show that God’s
electionis born of his free purpose, and not from those whom he
is about to elect, he says that the free purpose is the cause why
all things work for good to those who love God. Nothing is
ascribed to man's merit. For he adds: For whom he foreknew
(pronunciavit) he also predestinated to be ¹conformed to the
image of his Son, etc. I have translated προέγνω by “ pronun·
clavit,” which word has the same force as if you should say
predetennined or foreordained. This is then the apostle's mean·
ing: I said that all will result in good for those who according to
God's purpose are of the called. This Ι would have understood

thus: God ireely with himself settles upon, prejudges and fore·
ordains (for by this word the word for “ purposing” is ex· χ
pounded) whom he will, even before they are bom. Whom he
thus loreordains he marks out beforehand, i. a, destines them to
be conformed to the image oi his Son. As ii he should say:
No one can be conformed to Christ unless he has been destined
