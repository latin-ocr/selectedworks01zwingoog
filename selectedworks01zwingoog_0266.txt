asleep? You may note here in passing, reader, that this argu-
ment is used partly in behalf of infant baptism. For it they
supposed that with baptismal or lustral water they accomplished
something for the dead, much less would they refuse it to children.
For they would do this according to the Lord’s word, for that
they would have no document. Third, consider this, which he .
adds: And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? Ι die daily,

etc. For this, too, tends hither. Paul means: If either nolite
follows this, or a sleep more than Epimenidean,*1 should be
foolish to undergo every danger daily. But it is very different.
Etemal life follows this immediately, for otherwise Iwould not
expose myself rashly to dangers of this kind. Foutth, he says:
Let us eat, etc, and even “Perverse communications cormpt
good manners” points this way. For nothing equally corrupta
manners with teaching that the soul dies, or, as the Catabaptists
now blaspheme, sleeps till the last day, and then they affirm that

the devil aud all are saved. What penalty then awaits the faith- =

less and criminali This corruption would not spread so widely
if they only denied that the flesh would live again. Fifth,
consider this, too: Eknepsate dilraios, i. a, be vigilant. These
words reflect Paul’s lreenness. For when they, pressed in the sleep
of ignorance, suppose (like the wolf which believes that all ani-
mals eat raw flesh because it does so itself) that souls sleep, he
says therefore wake up. And when because of their keenness
these little scholars seem to themselves by no means to sleep, be
rightly says wake up. For you think that you are awake and
have hit the nail on the head when you are dreaming so som·
nolently about sleep. After this weigh carefully the following,
reader, and when you see that the apostle at first is speaking in
general about the life of the soul after this life, and thence comes
to the resurrection of the flesh, return to this and you will' see
that the Catabaptists are oppressed not so much by sleep as by
evil, and teach¹ whatever occurs to them.

*According to the tale Epimenides slept fifty-seven years.
