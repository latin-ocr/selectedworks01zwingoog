PERORATION.

1 doubt not, most pious render, that you heve long missed in
ns thnt direction oi Paul: Bear with one another in love, endeav-
oring to keep the nnity oi the spirit in the hond oi peace. But
ior your missing it, rre who are on the side oi true baptism are
not in inuit. For nothing grieves us so much ss their audacity.
For though, as the apostle continues, rre are one body and one
soul or spirit, in thntrre are called to one and the same hope,
they are unwilling to hear the epostle’s varning. For secretly
they hsve taught what is not right, doubtless not knowing “One
Lord, one taith, one baptism.” So it is not strange that they
have leit us, since they who do not see those things are not oi
us. 1t is yours meanwhile to advance in the iesr oi the Lord,
and to guard yourseii irorn the hypocrisy oi evil men. Farewell,
and pray ior the victory ior truth. 1 turn to the ⁴‘ Disputation at
Baden,” which everybody says hasbeen distortedintentionally by
the printers, but which I have not yet had time to read, so that
ii it requires refutation at my hands I may give it* Be assured
that all this when it was printing was snatched from the jaws oi
the pen.

⁸ Baden is a town only 12 miles northwest oi anich, hut such n centre oi
the bitterest ioes oi Zwingli thet he did not venture to go thither to attend
the Disputation. it was the Old Chnrch’s repiy to the Zurich Disputation oi
1523, end lasted horn May erst to June 18rh, 1526. The Acts were published

st anern, May 18,1527.
