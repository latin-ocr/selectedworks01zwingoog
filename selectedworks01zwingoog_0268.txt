they preach unless they ,are sent? let him hear, Catabaptists.
By what authority, pray? That oi the father ol lies and strife.
IV. Wherever it suits, the Catabaptists deny Scripture and
assert their own spirit. But we know that Scriptures are to be
interpreted by the spirit, but not by that contentious and rash
spirit which the Catabaptists excite, rather hy the true, eternal,
peacelul and seli-consistent spirit. We know also that Christ
appealed to Scripture, who yet gave by sign and teaching suffi-
cient prooi whether he spolre from God, so that neither a Cata-
baptist nor any other should dare to demand credence ior himself
when he speaks without Scripture authority. So that very won-
derful is the effrontery with which they dare to demand Scripture
prooi ior infant baptism, rather from non-scripture. For they
have nothing hy which they may trust in Scripture, but only a
negative basis alone when they say: We do not read that the
apostles baptized iniants, therefore they should not be baptized.

· They ward ofl all Scripture by the hoss ot an asserted spirit. Spum

not prophecy, they say, and do not extinguish the spirit· Right
enough! But what is added? Prove all things. We shall then
prove the spirit, tor the divine John wams not to trust every
spirit, but to prove them whether they are of God. llou deny
that Christ is by nature the Son oi God, the propitiation ior the
sins oi all the world. Your spirit is then not oi God by John’s
test. So we spum your prophecy no otherwise than as when Saul
put himself into the company oi prophets. Yon extinguish the
spirit by your rebaptism. Why not, when it is so often sub·
merged? For it is not that spirit which at the foundation of
the world brooded over the waters, but that which hurled itselt

· into swine with the great damage oi the neighbors, itselt doubtless

swimming out and leaving those amid the swamps oi Gennesaret
who ought to have solaced the winter oi the poor. Atteud to
the allegory.
