follow, “He does not believe, therefore is not elect.’' For the 3
elect are ever elect, even before they believe. When therefore ’ j

it is said: ‘⁶ Who believeth not shall be condemned,” it must be
that iaith is used ior that chain already spoken oi, so that the
meaning is: ⁴⁸ Who is not elect shall not be saved.'’ Or else lor
this, that it means ⁴⁸ to be within the faithful people,'’ or (as best
approves itseli to my reason) that it is said synecdochically oi
those alone who have reached that point that they can under-
stand language—Who believeth not shall be condemned. For
iaith is not of all the elect, as now is clear oi elect iniants, but
itis the imit oi election, predestination and calling, which is

not is condemned, does not include those who are elect but do
not reacb to maturity oi faith, to save them the less. By tbe
words, Who hath believed and Who hath not believed, it may
therefore be inferred they are not included who by reason oi

gospel has not come. It may also be inferred that those sayings,
Who hath believed, etc, and Who hath not believed, have not
the sense oi precedence, as though iaith necessarily preceded all,
ι’. e., electiori, predestination and calling. Foris this is true,
then that antecedent determination or purpose or predestination
oi God would not be free, but electiori would follow theu finally,
when saith had rendered the man suitable ior election. For
only those could be elected who already believed, the contrary oi
which is clear. But the words have the “ sense oi consequence :”
Be assured that he who believes has been elected by the Father
and predestined and called. He believes therefore because he
has been elected and predestined to eternal salvation, and he
who believeth not has been repudiated by the iree electiori oi

God. And here is disclosed to us the power oi the lreys, so iar
