Reply. So ier you have discussed what you decided about the
oeth. Ι will then reply to euch error in order by ite number,

to avoid etemel repetition ol your remarks. 1. Who, pray, has ³

given you this definitidn ol an oath? Yon heve indeed touched
on the practice but the essentiel nature oi an etth you either do
not know or meliciously pnes by. llou tell only what an oath
we use, but what it is or how taken you say nothing of. 1t you
should tell this fmnkly, an oath would cause no great dread in
men, but this would not suit your designs, lor you wish to destroy
the magistracy and the power of which it consiste. Talre away
the oath and you have dissolved all order. The burgomaster
summoue a senator who does not obey. You say: Let him have
the policeman errest him. How will he obey? The burgomester
sees a Catabeptist inciting the people to rebellion‚ end, wishing
to see that no evil beialls the state, he orders him not to'teaoh
iu secret (lor they who are on the side ol the gospel in sincerity
easily overcotne him when he teaches openly). Or he forbids
him to teach publicly or privately‚ and orders the Catabaptist to
be urrested when he despises every order. But the policeman
does not obey. Who will arrest [the Catabaptist]-the burgo-
master? But the other is stronger. llou see, good madet, all
order is overthrown when the ooth is done away. still, it the
Scriptures required this, Ι would not oppone, ior he by whose pro
vidence all is govemed will never leil the house ol Israel. But
he uills not this confusion. Give up the oath in any state then
