it sprung from that usage that before the lord's Suppes the
excommunicate and banned were publiclyinterdicted. Ido not
think it came from the institution of Christ that some ancients
and some moderna had and have the custom of thus naming:
let no homicide, usurer, adulterer, drunkard, etc, approach.
For if an adulterer or drunlrard, or one addicted to any other
crime, defile the church he ought to be wamed according to the
command of Christ, and if he refuse to confess after the testi-
mony of witnesses before the church he ought to be shunned or
to be excluded from the church, but so only if contumacious.
But it only rumor travels around (it is sometimes mendacious),
or he who is under suspicion can rightly ward it off, so that he
appears to carry himself honestly‚ then he ought not rashly to be
excommunicated, unless the thing is absolutely certain for which
he is excommunicated. This I say not of myself, but after com-
paring carefully and weighing the words of Jesus on this subiect.
For when he says to Peter that one is to be forgiven seventy-seven
times, and in another place orders the tares to be permitted to
grow until harvest, he evidently shows that there are some things
at which fraternal love may wink. But when, on the other hand,
he commands to expel straightvay after the reproof of the church
has been despised he surely means in those matters which are
manifest and may defile the church. For there are some, sad to
say, too ready on one side or the other. Some who think that
nothing reaches to the point of requiring dismission, perhaps
besam they labor under the same oran equal disease; there are
others who, if some passion persuades them, at once cry out:
Why is he not excommunicated? Moderation therefore in this
matter with the greatest diligence (which is to be sought from
the Lord) is to be observed here. But what reason is there why
the Catabaptists should say aught to us about excommpnication
when they have not considered the judgment of, or how they
ought to judge, the murder that took place inst. Gall, when a
Catabaptist murdered a Catabaptist and a brother a brother?
