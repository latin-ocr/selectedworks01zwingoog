REFUTATION OF BAPI'IST TRlCKS. 231

the day of Christ the Saviour. Which bosom (it one likes that
word) is now to us the heaveuly association with the Son ol
God and with all who are with him.

Paul, wherever there arises a question about the difference
, between Jews and Gentiles who had saith, carefully proves that
one people and one church arises from both. In Rom. xi. he
makes election the basis of this ; formerly the Jews were ογ elec-
tion the people of God, now the Gentiles are. Yet not in such
. a way that from the Jews none might any longer be within the

that he might reconcile both unto God in one body ογ the cross,
the enmity being slain in himself. And he came and preached
peace to you that were afar off, and to those also who were nigh.
For through him we both have access to the Father in one spirit.
Now therefore ye are no more strarrgers and foreigners, but fellow
