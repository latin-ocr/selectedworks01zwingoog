aa Irenaeus testifies in hia first book! At St. Gall public charges
were made against two girls who had been oi unblsmed modesty
tmtil they had gone over to the Catabaptisn, but whose modesty
had suffered shipwreclr when their bodies were immersed in cata·
baptism. They affirmed that they were betrothed in spiritum

marriage, the rings being accepted, and in one night on one κ

couch two Catabaptists had so loosed their virgin belts that the
couch, groaniog ior a long time, at length, impatient oi the
burden, threw on the lloor with one crash the two marriages.
Those who heard the downlall swore solemnly that those spirits
naue aucha sound that it appeared as ii iour bodies had fallen
irom on high. I beg you, render, not to go away before consid·
ering that the iorce oi hypocrisy surpasses even the attack ol lust.
By which they may be the less seli-complacent who, evenis they
were chaste (which l do not mysell believe), yet were such in
order to lay up ior themselves this glory among morrala For
those very· girls had before been tempted to the crime, but in
vain. Hypocrisy is therefore more potent than the flesh, tor
under the pretext oi the Spirit and by deceit it has carried the
tower oi virginity. Why should I spealr oi the open adulteries,
which, although many, are iew in comparison with those con-
cealed by their skill? But who can fittingly tell oi the awiul
murder which a brother perpetrated upon his own brother in St.
Gall?† What ability in worda can worthily set iorth so great

⁸ Irenaeus, Adv. Haer„ 1., vi„ 3. The passage is as lollowsr

‘⁴ Some oi them are in the habit oi defrling those women to whom they have
taught the above doctrine, as has trequently been contessed by those women
who have been led astray by certain ol them, on returning to the Charch oi
God, aud aclrnowledgiug this along with the rest ol their errors. Others oi
them, too, openly and without a blush, having become passionately attached
to certain women, seduce them away irom their husbands and contract mar·
riages oi their own with them. Others oi them again, who pretend at first to
live in all modesty with them as sisters, have in course ol time been rewealed

in their true colors, when the sister has been iound with child by her [pretended]
brother.'’ (Ante Nicem Fadum, Chr. Lit. Co., ed. i.. 3²4)
