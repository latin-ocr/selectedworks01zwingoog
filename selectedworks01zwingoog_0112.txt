interrupta: That we wish to hear] For when he inaugurated
among the Corinthians the custom ol the sacrament as he had
received it lrom the Iord he said among other things: Cetera,
cum venero, disponam. 1 Cor. xi. 34. “And the rest will 1 set
iu order when Ι come.” There St. Paul announces that he will
lurther teach- them to honor and to use the sacrament. But
that such was true, aad that the twelve apostles gave instruc·
tions, presenting them as traditions which were not decreed by
the Gospel‚ 1 shall prove from St. Paul to the Thessalonians.
Master Ulrich interrupta, asking: Where is it written? The

always to God of you, brethren beloved, etc.‚ because God hath
chosen you to salvation, etc, through belief ol the truth‚ where-
unto he called you by our gospel‚ etc. Thereiore‚ brethren‚
stand last and hold the traditions (i. e., teachings) which ye
have been taught, whether by our word or our epistle.” [Here

the traditions, whether emanating from his words or his epistle.

people ol Corinth which before had not been decreed, I say no,
ior he says in the same place: “For I have received oi the iord
that which alsoI delivered unto you.” But when he says:
“And the rest willI set in order when I come,” it does not mean
what the vicar says; on the contrary he is punishing the Corin·
thians on account ol misuse and mistalre in the taking and use
