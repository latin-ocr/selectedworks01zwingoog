Therelore your Fatherhood ought to regard it as wise loresight
aud not unreasonableness that we come to petition you. For
unless wise aid be applied in many places it will be all up with
the whole body oi ecclesiastice. And please do not refer us to
the deerees ol the predecessors ol your Fatherhood. For you
see how they fail to meet the case, and delay in the hope that
though we have been first beaten with rods we can then presently
endure the sting oi scorpions. Our weakuess must be indulged,
nay, something must be ventured in this matter. Ο happy the
invincible race ol Hohenlandenberg, it you shall be the first ol

even the highest priests took upon their neclrs the gentle yoke ol
matrimony3 we have Christ, who makes chastity trec, nay, bids us
marry, that his little children may not be offended, and our petition
meets with loud approval ou all sides. Nay, even Paul, speaking
with the spirit of God, enjoins marriage. All the company ol the
pious and judicious are with us. Il you disregard all this [we
know not how you can embrace your race with affection, for you
will surpass their brave deeds, aud win rnore than their laurels
and statues, il you only grant us this favour. Il, however, you '
cannot possibly be persuaded to grant it, we beseech you at least
