v REFUTATION OF BAP'I'IST TRICKS. 155

’ families baptized. Here is Scripture for you! That master ot
’ ours thinks they cannot be reclroned in; who will dare to con·
, tradict him? Zwingli, he says, thrusts children into the family
¹ without scripture. What then ii upon you, you raging wild ass
(for Ι would not call him a man who I think was baptized among
the shades on the Phlegethon* both because it seems tunny to
strive with ghosts and because Ι am not sure, even though I arn led
by certain assured conjectures to conclude who is the author oi so
learned a confutation †)—upon you I should bring down loads ot
proof from scripture, irom which you may leam that children are
to be reckoned in baptized families. In Acts ii. 44 we read:
μ , And all that believed were together, and had all things common.
Here I aslr: Did the believers have their children with them or
not? Ii they did, were they not in their families? Ii not, how

, ’ is it we nowhere read that they were anxious because he who

believed could not have his children with him? Was the spirit
that impelled themso cruel as to dictate the abandonment oi
their children? Oh l Yon do not mean that they did not have
them and nourish them, but that these did not belong to the
’ Christian iamilyl Iaslr then what you mean by family? You
will doubtless say: Those who had corne to such an age that
, they knew what law is and what sin is, lor he must repent who
¹wishes to be baptized, but since iniants cannot repent, they
cannot be included in the iamilyss Tbanlrs to God that you have

· learned to make so fine a rope ot saud, twisting out lie trom lie.

*Phlegethon was one ol the five rivers ol Hades.

¹ me document· is generally attributed to Conrad Grebel, who had been
, converted by Zwingli from a licentioris lile, and who became one oi bis ardent
· iollowers. He joined the radical party in Zuricb, and when Zwingli would
not go their lengths he turned against him, and in letters to Vadian, his
brother-iudan, abuses him. See Die Vadianische Briessammlung‚ ed. Athena,
possim. Grebel belonged to a prominent Zurich family. His lether was be·
headed as a traitor (November, 1526), and he himsell was banished irom the
’ city lor his Baptist laith in 1525, and died oi the plague the next year at
· Maienleld,inthe canton ol St. Gall andacouple'ot miles north ot Ragata. · ’
