may be cut by the one axe oi synecdoche. For ii there were
iniants in that tamily, what is said about taith and doctrine we
apply to those who could receive and believe, but what is said oi

master, but through age or wealtness neither heard nor believed.
For when God said: Hear, Ο Israel, the Iord thy God is one
God, he spolre to all who were oi lsrael. But because the iniants
neither hear nor understand he does not exclude them so that
they are not oi the congregation oi the people oi God or should

speech to the effect that where Scripture speaks oi believers
baptized, iniants, too, are included among them, as he strives to
prove by perverting the Scripture passages that do not contain
this.

Reply. I pass over, Ο shade, what that Wittenbergian did with

age does not exclude iniants, eve'n though it does not mention
them. For that does not exclude which does not explicitly
menti0n3 ior to pass over is one thing, to exclude, another. That
may be omitted which is in no way excluded. The excluded
can never come into the account. Since then the omitted, as
well as those expressly mentioned, are included by synecdoche
(as hasbeen sufficiently shown), we are still waitingior you to
prove that exclusion oi yours by which you assert iniants are
