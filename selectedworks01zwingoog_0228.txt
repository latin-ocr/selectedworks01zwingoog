is adoration. Just as it would be illegitimate to infer: The
throne is not to be adored, therefore God is not. So it is no less
illegitimate: By the throne oath is not to be taken, therefore
not by him who sits upon it.

(ό) When they speak oi the testimonias oi Peter and Paul,
they do not know ol what they chatter. They have not yet
learned that the word “ testify ” is in most elegant nse among the
Hebrews for proclaiming a thing boldly and constantly. That
one may give testimony is clear from 1 Tim. v. 19: Against an
elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses.
1 ask first whether the apostle speaks hereos Christian witnesses
or the unbelieving? If oi the nnbelieving, then every moment
bishop and church are in danger. For the more holy and inno·
cent one is, the more do the perfidions aasail him ; and Paul
seems to have ill advised for the church and the bishop when he
has given the nubelieving the opportunity to testify. But if he

’ speaks of witnesses within the church, it results that a Christian
may give testimony. My second question then is—were they

who gave testimony sworn or not? If unswom‚ again the bishop
is in peril, for there are many false brethren‚ many who the more
vigilantly the bishop watches, the more hostilely aim athis depo·
sition. ln short, it is,the fact in human affairs that there are
few whom you can believe unsworn ; indeed they say that among
the Romans in reality Cato was the only one whom they could
believe without an oath. In fact it is not very likely that within
the church witnesses were ever received wlthont oath, lor under
the spirit and prudence that was poweriul with them they easily
saw that if men unsworn were accustomed to speak against the
bishop‚ daily'empty accusations and movementa would be aroused
against the bishop. It you had weighed this testimonya little
more carefully, ye immersers not only of bodies, but of souis, you
would not teach that an oath may not be taken. But what good
do I hope from you? For whatever yon assert you affirm willingly
and wittingly against the Scripture.
