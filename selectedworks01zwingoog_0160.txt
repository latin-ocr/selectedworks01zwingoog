led to his expulsion lrom the city. He visited his brethren in South Gennany
and Switzerland, everywhere at the peril ot his liie. At last, wearied in body
aud mind from incessant wanderings and debatings‚ he cameto Basel in the
autumn ol 1527, and threw himselt upon the gentle and generous protection
ot OEcolampadius, who cheerlully received him and conscientiously, though
vainly‚ strove to convert him. But soon he was attached bya power no earthly
protector could eope with-he tell sick ot the plague and died in Basel,
November, 1527. He was a pure, honest and noble man and line scholar.
Ludwig Haetzer (or perhaps ottener written Hetzer, i. e., baiter, as being
an objectionable torm, and therelore more snitable lor a hated “Anabaptist ”)
was born at Bischolszell, near St. Gall, Switzerland, about 15003 educated at
Freiburg im Breisgau, and becarm proficient in Latin, Greek and Hebrew.
He lived in the circle ol the early Swiss Retormers, and showed himsell a bril·
liant though excitable youth. When chaplain at Wadenschwyl, on the south
shore ot the Lake ol Zurich, and fitteen and a hali miles trom the city, he
published a widely read pamphlet advocating the destruction ol the images in
the churches, the consequence oi which was that on September 29, 1523, the
crucilix in one oi the city churches was destroyed. In the Second Zurich
Disputation (October 26-28, 1523,) he came into prominence, and drew up
the official report. In Zurich he remained lor months occupied in literary work,
but there he joined the radicals, who eventually became the first Swiss Baptist
party. In the end ol June, 1524, he went to Augsburg, with a letter ol recom-
mendation trorn Zwingli‚ but returned at the end oi the year, and then allying
himself with the Baptist party he was ordered lrom the city, January 21, 1525.
He went again to Augsburg‚ and tound employment with the printer Ottmar.
But his associations with the dreaded and detested Baptists caused his banish-
ment in the autumn. By way ol Constance and Basel, where OEcolampadius
received him as he had Denk, he came once more to Zurich and won at length
the return ol Zwingli’s confidence. But he had not altered his opinions,
although ont ol prudence he concealed them, and when he published a book
revealing his Baptist views Zwingli did not stay his banishment trom Zurich.
So in March, 1526, he was back iu Basel. Then, at Strassburg (whence he
was banished in the end oi December, 1526), and later in Worms, he trans·
lated the prophetical books ol the Old Testament from the Hebrew, and with
Denk issued the volume as already mentioned. The two were expelled (June,
1527,) arrd Haetver went again to Augsburg, whence he had to go, in the

spring oi 1528. These repeated and now long-continued experiences ol ’

persecution seem to have broken his spirit. He went to his native village,
