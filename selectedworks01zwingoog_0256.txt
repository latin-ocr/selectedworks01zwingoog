REFUTA'I’ION 01³ namur meus· 243

as they were given to the apostles. When one says that he
believes, the apostle promises him: ll thou believest from thy
beart, be it sure to thee that thou art called, predestined and
elected to eternal salvation. Therefore this man ol ours is
absolved and justified, about which we have spoken above. But
when the apostle sees that there is no faith in those that hear, he
is sure that they are rejected. They are then ordered to shake
off the dust lrom their feet, that is, to go quickly from such, not
as though now first these deserve to be shunned, but because
the apostles are now first made sure of their rejection by their
aversion rotaith: on the other hand, when they see the saith
they are sure of their election. So therefore such words were
said ast By their truits ye shall know them. A good tree cannot
hear evil imit, nor an evil tree good fruit. Who believeth shall
doubtless be saved, for saith is the fruit of election, so that, ye
apostles, ye may have an indication of success. But who does
not believe alter arriving at years ol maturity for receiving your ’

From all this we make two necessary inferences. First, that

Ι we are sure ol the salvation of those who show saith when they

reach that maturity that ought to show the fruit of electi0n; it
they do not show this we are contrariwise sure ot their reiection.
Behold how we recognize salvation or shipwreck by the saith
alone of the elect or rejected who have reached that maturity
when we may expect saith, the fruit of election. So that infants
born to those who are in the covenant and people ot God we
may not measure by the norm and touch-stone ol saith. Second,
since those alone who have heard and afterward either believe or
remain in their untaith are subiect to our judgment, we err
gravely in jndging the iniant children both of the Gentiles and
of Christians. ot the Gentiles, forno law condemns them,
they do not iall under that sayiug: Who believeth not, etc.
Tben since the election ot God is unrestrained, it is impions lor
