REFUTATION OF Bnmsr TRICKS· 205

sounded to us ol heavenl Where are you, pray, when you say
these things? In the world, Ι thinkl So you, too, are in this
world. Ii then a Christian may not be a magistrate because his
habitation isin this world, then you are not Christians, ior you
are in the world. But how is a Christian's habitation in heaven?
In that he lives there in contemplation and moves thither in
possession and in fruition, no doubt* Thereiore a judge, since
he is ever engaged in contemplation ol God, since he is every
moment considering the saiety of the people under him and the
rendering ot exact justice to each, is he notin heaven, so iar as
contemplation is concerned, rather than all the Catabaptists, who,

and watch, as a bishop and pastor should, but they are like wolves
that lie in wait iu the lorests, that seize the prey and liee, that
burn and then escape. The arms oi these are carnal and against
the flesh, they say, but Christians’ are spiritual and against the
forts oi the devil. They do not need me as a teacher here, lor
we see clearly enough that their wars are not against the flesh,

for in all they yield to it. So earthly magistrates, they say, are
armed with brass and iron; Catabaptists with hypocrisy and evil
speaking, lies, iniury, discord, laithlessness, disaster and the word
of the devil—to give them altogether the gitts that are theirs in
