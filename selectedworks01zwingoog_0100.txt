which is read in the mass, and in which invocation and interces-
sion oi the saints are referred to, l say one sees readily that the
canon has not been made by one alone, but composed by several.
For there are many useless words therein, as haec dona, haec
munera, etc, from which may he inierred that it has not been
made by one scholar. The apostles never celebrated mass thus ;
one also finds thatin several instances the custom oi the canon
is different from ours, which I shall point out and shortly prove,
ii God wills it. Conceming the miracles which are done by the
saints we have spoken before. Who lrnows through whom or
why God decrees this? ¹ We should not attribute this so readily
ou account ol our unbeliei to the saints when we hesitate con-
cerning Christ and run to those creatures ior help. This all is
prooi oi a weak saith and small hope in Jesus Christ, whom we
do not rightly and entirely trust. Why do we flee from Him and

yea never thought oi during his titetime! To he sure, when you relerred to
Jerome in regard to the intercession oi the saints, he said the argument which
Jerome uses there has no basis in the Scriptores.” (⁶¹ Gyrenrupien.”)]

⁴* [‘¹You have omitted that Zwingli even spoke against the public Gos·
pel: ‘when one says that the saints accomplished miracles then the devil
has done it.'’' (Faber.) “About the intercession oi the saints-he prom·
ises a separate book: ‘the whole heavenly host will be with me, without
suppressing Christ, but rather let him be mediator! Luchsinger answers:
He (Faber) thinks because Zwingli said something about the wrong craze
ior miracles, therefore no one should remember that any more, and each one
think perhaps something has been said about it; it doubtlessly was as Hans
Heyerli (Faber) said· The matter is thisr Hans Heyerli and D. Martin
Blansch, oi Tilbingen, wished to prove the intercession oi the saints by means
oi the miracles (which has all occurred now in a roundabout manner, iuras
every one knows they have attached no article). Yes, the saints have done
miracles. Zwingli answered: Miracles are not a sign oi divinity, as Christ
himseli declares, Matt. vii. 22, but where real miracles do occur through the
saints God does them himself, never the saints, as St. Peter speaks in the Acts
iii. But there occur many miracles by the aid ol the devii, so Matt. xxiv. 24:
lle also accomplishes miracles, and changes himself into the shape oi an angel ol
light. Thus Zwingli spoke, and that lool distorta it thus.” (⁶⁶ Gyrenrupien.”)]
