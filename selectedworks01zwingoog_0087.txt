good for man to be thus,” but Paul adds, vii. 7, and says: “But
every man hath his proper gift of God, one after thie manner
and another after that.” Therefore Paul places no restrictiori
upon the marriage of priests, and indeed writes expressly: “A
bishop (i. a, priest) and a deacon shall have a sober wife and
well-bred children ;” and furthermore he permits marriage to all
people, and says, 1 Cor. vii. 28, 7: “But andif thou marry thou
hast not sinned. But every man bath his proper gift of God,”
etc. It is evident from this that marriage is not forbidden to
priests by divine law, and that chastity is to be maintained, not
by meahs of our resolutions, but with the help of the grace of
God. This real truth and wisdom of God Christ also proves to
us, Matt. xix. ro,1a: “His disciples say unto him, if the ease
of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry. But
he said unto them, all men cannot receive this saying save they
to whom it is given. And there be eunuchs which have made
themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake (that is,
due to the evangelical doctrine). He that is able to receive ft
let him receive it !” Do you hear that Christ says here that it is
:not possible for all people to keep chastity except such as have
‘received it from God? Hence He does not forbid the twelve
tapostlea to marry. Nor did God in vain give Adam a woman as
'helpmate ; He could have given him a manas helpmateif He
had wished to keep him chaste. But He said: “Crescite et
multiplicamini i'’ And although this is known to every one, still
the pope is able, by means of his ordinance, to demand from
each priest or other ecclesiastic chastity and that he be unmarried
contrary to divine law, and he can weigh down the poor con-
sciences corrupted by sin and shame ; and he permits public
offense and sin contrary to the suuny and pure ordinance of
God. lsay that Ι know of no greater scandal in Christendom
than that marriage is forbidden to priests (1 am speaking about
the pastors ; the others let them lie, whatever they do), yet they are
allowed to commit fornication publicly as long as they give money.
