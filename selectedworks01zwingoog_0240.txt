prophetesses among the Gentiles, that we might recognize the ff
liberty of his will and the authority ol his election* But theirs
are tlte fathers also, men filled with God, some oi whom, though
almost the whole world was living a bestial lite (ior where God is
not worshiped what differente is there between man and beasti)
and was following its own raging allectione, alone honored God,
believed his word and submitted themselves to his will. Others
boldlyannounced the good things· which through the in-breathing

’ ol the Holy Spirit they saw coming to the obedient and God-
fearing, or the evil in store ior the rebellious, impious and contu-
macious. These,I say, were the fathers, whom we call patriarcha
and prophets, to whom the promises were made, and they came
oi the Israelites, the people oi God.

· In short (for why should we nse much testimony in so clear a
matteri),I mean this: The israelites were God's people with
whom he entered into covenant, whom he made especially his
own, to whom also he gave a sign oi his covenant from the least
to the greatest, because high and low were in covenant with him,
were his people and were oi his church. And when, in giving
command or prohibition, he addresses that whole people, thein-
tants are not excluded because they understand nothing oi what
is said or commanded, but he speaks synecdochically, so that so
lar from excluding that part which could receive nothing that
came because oi the times or its age he even includes it, justas
when a person acts with a man he acts also with all the lamily
and his posterity. So that he often addresses the whole people
as oue man: Hear,0 Israel, and: Say to the house oi Jacob,
etc.

Thereiore the same covenant which he entered into with Israel
he has in these latter days entered into with us, that we may be
one people with thern, one church, and may have also one cove-
nant. Ι suppose that some will vainly cry out: See how that
lellow would make Jews ol us, though we have always been told
