Jacob to speak.

To this Master Ulrich answered that he had never thought of
the said Master Jacob, nor would it have occurred to him that
he should speak concerning this, etc.

Thus there arose a dispute; some of the councilors wanted the
matter to be settled before the chapter, since it had been corn·
menced there; the others thought that it should be tried in the
presence oi the scholars and gentlemen; but finally the matter
was no more thought oi and thus quieted, perhaps leit to the
chapter and thus remained unreierred to. This Ι report
(although not serving much to the purpose) that I may not be
accused oi not understanding and refuting all speeches and op·
