away the sword so that they may the more freely throw all into
confusion. There is no need for you to say that there are so
many impious that there is no danger of taking away the sword
by their preaching. For they do not go to the impious. But
when they see those who have embraced the gospel-even now
so great a number that ifthey should undertake todo what those
do who defend the pope they might hope to come off superior-
if they could draw these to their faction, all magistracy and obli-

they deny that it can be employed among Christians. When
therefore they lead us to Christ, who offered himself as an example
to us of gentleness and humility, they wish to appear to have
done right 3 indeed they would in our judgment also have done
right if faith were with thern. For if it were, they would con·
