just as much as at Worms upon the New. If you admit it not
to be true, what boldness is it to simulate the divine Spirit witb

[Adam] himself nor his descendants it he had not eaten of the same with his
mind, so also the bodily suffering of Jesus Christ is not real satisfaction and
reconciliation with the Father without internal obedience and the greatest
desire to yield to the eternal will.

“ Of these articles thus formulated, no one must be judge except only He who
speaks and testifies in the hearts of all men, as Scripture says. For no man
has been commanded by God to call the truth into judgment, but only 1ο testify.”

It must be confessed that some of these Articles were repugnant to the pre·
vailing orthodoxy, but in a less strenuous time they could have been debated
without persecuting those who held them.

There were at that time close connections between the Reformed in Worms
aud in Strassburg, and many of the Baptists in the former place had come from
the latter. Accordlngly the Strassburg Reformed pastors issued, onJuly2, 1527,
a pamphlet entitled: “A faithful waming 01 the preachers of the gospel in
Strassburg against the Articles which Jacob Kautz, preacher at Worms, has
lately issued conceming the fruit of the Scripture and the Word of God, infant
Baptism and the redemption 01 our Lord Jesus Christ, and other doctrines.’'

There is no evidence that the purposed debate ever came 011, but the city
banished Kautz, along with Denk and Haetzer, and henceforth he was a wan·
deret. He went first to Augsburg, then to Rothenburg and in the beginning
01 1 528, 10 Strassburg. There he had a debate with Capito and Butzer, June,
1528, and remained at liberty till January, 1529, when he was cast into prison
101 street preaching. He was released only to be banished. He is heard 01
only twice again. In 1532, he applied in vain for permission to return to
Strassburg; in 1536, he was teaching school in Moravla. The date and place
of his death are unknown.

The allusion 1ο a Baptist denial of the whole Old Testament at Worms is to
that by the company 01 Baptists already mentioned as gathered in that place.
· Grilningen, which is also mentioned in that connection, is a village in the Can·
ton of Zurich‚ and twelve miles southeast 01 that city and some three miles
back of the north shore of the lake. It was an early Baptist important center
and, therefore, a scene of ruthless persecution.

Capito in his letter to Zwingli 01 June 9, 1527 (see latter’s Works, viii, 76-
78) reveals the attitude of the Strassburg Reformed clergy towards the Baptists,
to whom he had for a while inclined. He charges them with fantastic belief
and fanatic conduct. It is very likely there were mystics and fanatics among
them, but testimony from violently prejudiced quartem should be received with
cantion, for from all that appears, the rank and file of the'Baptists were good
and God-tearing people.
