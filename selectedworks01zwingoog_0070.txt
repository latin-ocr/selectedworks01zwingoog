THE FlRST ZURICH DISPUTATION. 57

present in Hebrew, Greek and Latin tongues3 these letus take
on both sides as iair and just judges?
Also we have here in our city, God be praised, many learned

colleagues who are as sufficiently taught in these three languages

contrary to proper understauding. There is therefore no reason
why excuse should here be made. Hence, dear friends, do not

territories and lands should no longer, as heretolore‚ be suspended
in doubt and dissension. With humble hearts call upon God.
He will not reiuse you His divine recognition, as the epistle oi
James promises, ii you ask in true saith, and do not let yourselves

spoke in Greek and other tongues. And therefore l rlid not boast, rightly,
about the langnegm, although 1 brought with me to you lrom Constance the
Hebrew and Greek Bible; also had thern both with you at the city hall, Do
