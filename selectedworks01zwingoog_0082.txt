and ordered by the fathers in council to which their successors
paid no heed. For example, that the mother of God conceived
without sin was decided in public council at Basel‚ and yet no
preaching monk is so foolish as to speak against it. Also many
ordinances or mles of the fathers are found which were changed
afterwards, especially in our times, and otherwise not kept or
given up by the influence of money, so that such things are
allowed which were formerly forbidden by the fathers. From
this we can see that councils have not always acted in the spirit
of the Holy Ghost, but sometimes according to human will and-k
judgment, which is of course forbidden by divine Scripture. For
the Holy Ghost does not say this to-day and to-morrow that,
but its ordinances and regulations must remain everlasting and
changeless. The pious fathers whom we call holy are not for
that reason to be dishonored and attacked as to their piety or
holiness. For nothing is easier or from native weakness more
natural than to err, especially when out of conceit or over-hasty
judgment depended upon their own opinion instead of upon
the rule of G0d¹s Word. This all shows us that the pillars and
supports of many of the fathers, as Angustiae and Jerome‚ are ’t
notin harmony in their wrltings; that often the one thinks not
only something else, but by Scripture proves the contrary. But
as to the fact that they say it would be too bad if we Christiane,
and especially our forefathers, had lived so long in error, since
from the time of Gregory the intercession of the saints has been
accepted and kept, I say that it is not aquestion of when a thing
begun in the Church. We know well that the litany was estab-
lished in the time of Gregory and kept down to the present. But
all we desire is to hear the scripture upon which my Lord Vicat
bases his recommendation that we should pray to the saints.
For if such a custom began at the time of Gregory then it did
not exist before* and if before that time men were Christians

Cyprian, 1300 years ago, there was intercession of the saints3 yes, I shall try it
still further back.’' (Faber.)]
