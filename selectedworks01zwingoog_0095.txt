hle Hercules quidem contra duos. Shall I strive with two?
That was considered even too difficult ior the strong Hercules
(according to a proverb of the ancients). Dear Sir, I have
nothing to do with you. ’

Leo: But 1 have something to do with you.

Vicar: I do not know who you are.

Leo: 1 shall gladly he your good friend in so far as you desire.

Vicar: That 1 shall not refuse,ior1am not here to become
an enemy oi any one. If you are then my good friend, as you
say, it will happen to us as to Socrates and Solon? who also
through argumentation became good friends.

Leo: Then you have one friend more than formerly.

To prevent such and other gibes Master Ulrich began to speak :
Would to God that the saying, Ne Hercules quidem, etc, would
be understood and followed as readily by some as it ordinarily
is the custom to quote it. Sir Vicar, we desire to hear the
quotation concerning the invocation and intercession of the

' saints, not such useless talk and nonsense.

VICAR.

It is the custom and usage oi Christian churches, and is kept thus
by all Christian folk confirmed by the litany and the canons missal,

* [“I.ook, how can you say that to excuse myseli 1 quoted in the
beginning the saying of Solon, how then it was written by the wisc man
Solon that when once he was sitting with scholars, who were debating,
and Periander asked him whether he was silent from lack oi words or because
he was a iool, he answered no lool can keep quiet? Therelore 1 did not refer
to Socrates (as you say), but to the saying of Xenocrates when he was one
time asked why he alone kept still and allowed all the others to speak, he had
answered that what 1 sometimes said 1 regretted, but that which 1 have not
said that l have never regretted. Thus it happened, and not otherwise, and
'as a witness oi the tmth 1 cited the proverb: Audiens sapiens sapientior erit.
And as another witness Zwingli intermpted the speech by saying that there was
no need ol fawning and hypocritical style. Now look how you have hit it?”
