very properly adduced as exampes, which showed it wasmore
probable than not that the apostles baptized infanta, the familias
of Stephanus, Lydia and of the warden of the prison. And these
examples you will never be able to do away with, as I shall clearly
show. You then continue to answer my examples thus:

Catabapntts. We reply first that Zwingli says in his book that
an act ol the apostles can prove nothing, which is not true.
Second, grant that it is true; the obscure testimony which he
alleges concerning the act ol Paul, 1 Cor. i. 16, and concerning
Lydia, can therefore by his own admission prove nothing.

Reply: 1 myseli recognize my own words, and Ι will not per·

follows rightly, if it can be obtained, that all ceremonies be
abrogated entirely, if this can not be done with public peace,
those can be tolerated on account ol the wealr which do not

involve impiety. For while the apostles permitted certain small
