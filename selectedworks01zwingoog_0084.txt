THE FIRST ZURlCH DlSFUTA'l'ION. 71

eternal suffering. Nor does ir do any good to say that there are few
people who will not feel comfort through the intercession oi the
saints. I say, where such help comes from God, we will not
judge why God acts thus and helpe man in such iashion as He
desires. But where this occurs lrom infatuation by the devil as
a judgment oi God upon the unbelieving man, what shall we say
then? Ye know well what work the devil has sometimes done
in many places, which it it had not been obstructed would have Ι
resulted in great deception and injury oi all Christendom.
Furthermore, that is an evil teaching which proclaims that other
nations will not consider us Chritsians il we do not obey the
ordinances, i. e, the laws ol former times, as this is ordered and
demanded by the papal decrees, For indeed there are many
ordinances in the canons oi the Roman bishops and popes which
the aforesaid nations do not obey and still they are none the less
Christians. Concerning the above Ι shall malre use oi the follow·

ing short comparison: Ecclesiastical property is (as they say) in
the power oi the Roman pope, and he may bestow and grant the
estates to whomsoever he pleases. Now look ye how this ord-
inanee is obeyed in Spain and France3 there the ecclesiastical
benefices or estates are not granted to any foreigner, let the
pope say what he pleases. But we foolish Germans must permit

the sending of stablemen and mule-drivers from the papal court
to take possession oi our benefices and curacies and be our
spiritual guides, although they are ignorant oi and know naught
concerning the Scriptores, and if we do not tolerate this we are
disobedient to the Christian Church. But the above-mentioned
nations do not obey the ordinance and still are without question
pious Christians. Hence, Sir Vicar‚ l desire that you do not
make use ot bombastic speeches, which do not even bear upon
my question, but, as I have aslred before, tell at once where is
written in the Scriptures concerning the holy invocation and
intercession of the Virgin Mary, as you pretended you could show
in Exodus, Baruch, etc. That is what we desire to hear. Hence
