collected in so short a time lor so large an assembly. I concede
also thata council will be announced in time. But meanwhile
how are we to treat those whose consciences have gone astray
so iar as to desire eagerly to know the tmth? Would yon rob
these thirsty souls oi the truth, let them hang in doubt, frighten
them by human ordinances, and let them live or die in uncer-
tainty as to the truth? Really, my pious brethren, this is no
small thing. God will not demand ol us what pope, bishop and
council establish and command, nor how long this or that has
been in praiseworthy and ancient usage, bnt He will find out
how His divine will, word and commandments have been kept*

Now finally, since reference is made to the judges which my
Lord Vicat thinks cannot be found outside the universities, I say
that we have here infallible and unprejudiced judges, that is the

⁶ [Hager in ⁴‘ Gyrenruplen ” presents the dispute about the council thus:
“Alter this Mr. Fritz, the majordomo, very cleverly presented the com-
mand ol his master, sayiug that bis master had been surely informed,
that irr a year there would be a council. Conceming this Zwingli did
not wish to speak. Thereupon you immediately began to speak, and rose
and said the sameas Mr. Fritz had just said, and in a nice way relerred
to the tumre council and sbowed yoursell a little more, just as it the matter
bad not also been commended to you. Thereupon Zwingli arose, and said we
should not be led astray by the council; he also bad had a letter in which he
was intormed how the German princes had demanded irom the pope that he
have a council within a year, but that tbe pope bad iormally assented had not
yet happened, nor is it possible (be said) tbat within the space ol a year a
general council could be gatbered togethe13 turtbennore the three migbtiest
lords, King ol France‚ Emperor, and King oi England‚ were at war with each
other, who could not easily be conciliated3 also that the fixing ol the counciy
would be leit to the Germans. Hence one could see that the promise ot a
council was only a postponement, not a definite resolve; but it mattered little
whether they had a council or not, lor he believed that uo man would live to
see a counc'rl in which tbe word ol God would be allowed to rule. Therelore,

even il a council should be held at once, one would not care either, lor we '

would depend upon and preach the word ol God; may the councils determine
herein what they please.’' Alter this he lrom Neltenbach arose and spoke.]
