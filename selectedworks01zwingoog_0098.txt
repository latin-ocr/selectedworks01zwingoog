be considered by pope or council asa mortal sin we do not think
that we are in duty bound to treat that the same as the Gospels 3
we wish to be free, not to burden our consciences with that.

E. g, ii pope or council commands us, at rislr of mortal sin, to
last, or to eat no egg, no butten no meat, which God has not
ordered us to do, Luc. x. 75 Col. ii. 16, 21, but is permitted
and made voluntary, therefore we will not believe that such and
other ordinances decreed by the councils are decreed by the
Holy Ghost, and to be respected equally with the Gospel. How
does it happen that they wish to order us to eat no eheese, no
eggs, no milk, but stinking oil, with which they scarcely oil their
shoes at Rome, and otherwise eat chickens and capons? But =
it one says it is thus written in the canons and decreed by the
fathers, Ι say it is written otherwise in Paul, and Christ has given
another and easier law. Now do we owe more obedience to
God or the Holy Ghost, or to human beings? Acts v. 32· But
when he declares the Church has decreed such, she cannot err,
I ask what is meant by “Church?'’ Does one mean the pope
at Rome, with his tyrannical power and the pomp of cardinals
and bishops greater than that ol all emperors and princes? then
Ι say that this Chureh has often gone wrong and erred, as every
one knows, since it has destroyed the land and its inhabitants,
burnt cities and ravaged the Christian people, butchering them
ior the sake of its earthly pomp, without doubt not on account
of a command ol Christ and his apostles. But there is another
Chureh which the popes do not wish to recognize; this one is
no other than all right Christians, collected in the name of the
Holy Ghost and by the will of God, which have placed a tirm
belief and an unhesitating hope in God, her spouse. That
Chureh does not reign according to the flesh powerfully upon
earth, nor does it reign arbitrarily, but depends and rests only
upon the word and will oi God, does not seek temporal honor
and to bring under its control much territory and many people
and to rule other Christiane. That Chureh cannot err. Cause:
