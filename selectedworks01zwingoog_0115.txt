Holy Ghost speaks from the Scriptures, For not more than once
(semel) by one offering he entered into the holy place; otherwise
be must die often? Now matters have come to such a state thet
the papists have made out oi the mass a sacrifice ior the living
and dead, contrary to the joylul Scriptures ot God; they wish to
protect this also, so that they may defend their name of scholar
or their avarice. We also know well that “missa'' does not
come irorn Hebrew or Greelr3 but you present nothing from the

Scriptures.

Iwill do that and prove it beiore the universities, where learned
judges sit. And choose a place, be it Paris, Cologne or Freiburg,
whichever you please; then 1 shall overthrow the Articles pre-
sented by you and prove them to be wrong.

I am ready, wherever you wish, as also to-day 1 offered to give
answer at Constance, if a saie conduct (as to you here) is prorn-
ised to me and respectcd. But no judge I want, except the
Scriptores, as they have been said and spoken by the Spirit
of God; no human being, whichsoever it be; and betore you
overthrow one Article the earth must be overthrown, for they are

the Word ol God.

· This is a queer affair. When, e. g, two are quarreling about

' an acre or about a meadow, they are sent belore a judge. Him

they also accept, and you reiuse to allow these matters to come
before a judge. How would this be il 1 should propose that you
talre my lotds oi Zurich as judges? Would you not accept
these and allow them to judge?

ln worldly affairs and iu quarrels 1 know well that one should
go before the judges with the disputes, and I also would choose
and have as judges my lords ol Zurich, since they possess justice.
