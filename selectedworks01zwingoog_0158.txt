REFUTATION 01⁴* amm* TRICKS. 145

add: This is salt-evident. As it any ass ever gaped so at a lyre
¹ as to believe him who asserted that boys did not belong to the
house or family.

Catabaptirts. Filth. According to the reason, opinion and
sentiment ol man no one ought to baptize or do anything else,
r but according to express Scripture or lact, as the mass ol testi-
mony oi divine Scripture proves. Just as Zwingli himself has
often exclaimed against the vicar* and other enemies ol God,
and will not admit anything which depends upon human judg-
ment or the custom ot the fathers. But now he hastens to do
what the enemies ol truth have thus tar done.

Reply. I arn always of the opinion you ascribe to me, and
have never held or will hold a different one while lite lasts. But
when you impute to me what the enemies ol truth have done
until now, you spealr from that spirit which has from the beginning
been false and has not been based on truth. For what else have
I ever done but confirm by testimony ol Scripture all that 1 have
given out? Not by authority, though Ι have some modicum ol
this3 not with clamor or hypocrisy. This will appear to my
readers in the progress of the discussion.

Catabaptr'rts. Paul teaches that what is not iu the gospel or
in the discourses ol the apostles is anathema.

Reply. Where, pray, does Paul teach this? I suppose you
refer to what he wrote in Gal. i. 8: But though we or an angel
from heaven preach to you otherwise than we preached let him
be anathema. I will expose your words here a little diligently,
for your ignorance and your malice will both be manifest. Your
ignorance because you suppose that when Paul wrote this the
gospel records and apostolic letters were already in the hands ol
the apostles and authoritative. As il even then Paul attributed
to his own letters (lor they are not the least part oi the books of
the New Testament) that whatever was in them was sacrosanct.

*Faben vicar general ol Constance. See note ohp. 46.
