when you undertook to overthrow synecdoche, for you saw this to
be impossible. This remains, and will ever remain‚ synecdoche:
The fathers were all baptized, the fathers all ate the same spiritual
rood with us, as was shown in the foregoing sufficiently and will
be treated again in the following. Thus lar I have replied to the
first part oi your refutation‚ to the rest I will do the same in the
course oi the disputation. Now I proceed to the second part.

sucoso Phar.-

This part is to overthrow the foundations oi your superstition;
although you have never published them, yet hardly any oi your
people exist who have not a copy oi these well founded laws‚ as you
call thern. Why, pray, do you not publish what are so divine and so
salutary? But counsels evilly conceived fear the light, and are
terrified at the judgment of learned and pious men. For this
reason you do not publish the dogmas, articles, principles oi your
superstition.¹ I therefore shall expose thern to the world, trans·
lated faithfully and literally into Latin. As in the first part, your
position shall corne first, then the refutation.

'lm OF THE CONSTI‘I'UTION OF THE SECI' OF THE CATABAPTISTS·

Articles which we have drawn up and to which we agree, viz. ε
Baptism, abstention, breaking of bread, avoidance oi abominable
pastors in the church, [oi love], sword and [of wrong] oath.

To this article I say the same as the apostle in Col. ii. ao: If
ye be dead with Christ from the elements ol the world, how is it
that you set forth decrees or dogmas as though you were in the
world? But I know what you will say: These are not human
dogmas, articles, principles, but divine oracles. To which I reply:
Why then do you say you have drawn thern up and agreed to
them? 1r they are divine, why do you call them the articles ol
your conspiracy? Why do you smear the mouth of the divine
word with your human ordure? Il not [divine], why do you
impose new decrees upon the neclrs oi your brethren? llou
