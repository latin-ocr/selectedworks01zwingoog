the wordwith simplicity and placidity. This opportunity these
[catabaptists] had eagerly looked tor, hoping that on this account
the meu would the more readily yield to their hypocrisy because
they displayed such great simplicity and eagemess.

NowI return to their trielrs, and thus Ι respond: When you
say that the family of Stephauas is one oi Zwingli’s bases ior
insisting on infant baptism, you show great disingenuousness.
For where, pray, have I ever postulated this, which you assert,
as a foundation? Have I not written a special boolr to the
unfaithiul Balthasar,* the apostate, in which I briefly showed upon

* Balthasar Ilubmaier was born at Friedberg, near Augsburg, about 1480,
educated at Freiburg in South Germany, became professor oi theology at Ingol-
stadt, and D. D., 1512. ln 1516 he went to Regensburg as cathedral preacher
and led the attaclr on the Jews, whose synagogue was destroyed. On its site a
Christian chapel was erected, and he was its first chaplain. In 1521 he removed
to Waldshut, near the border oi Switrerland, and this brought himin contact with
the Swiss Reiormers. He embraced their teachings and introduced the Reior-
mation into Waldshut,1524. In that year Hubmaier came under the inllu-
ence ol Thomas Miinzer, who confirmed him in the Baptist views he had
previously independently imbibed lrom his Bible study. His accession to the
ranks oi the Baptists was a great gain ol thern. He was quiclrly recognized
as their leading theologian. Driven out oi Waldshut in December, 1525, when
the city was captured by the Austrian troops aud the Relomation suppressed,
Hubmaier fled to Zurich. But his Baptist views made him suspected there, as
the Baptists, or Anabaptists as they were commonly called, were charged with
disturbing the public order and were under the ban ol the State. Hubmaier was
put in prison, tortured, compelled to recant, and finally driven out of the city.
He went to Constance, to Augsburg and finally into Moravia, everywhere pro·
claiming with eloquence aud success by voice and pen his Baptist views. There
was in those times. when religious liberty was a term unknown to Protestants
and Roman Catholics, and when Baptists especially were hunted to death by
all non-Baptists, only one possible end to such a career as his. He came into
the hands ol King Ferdinaud oi Austris, was talren to Vienna, 1527, and there
bumt at the stake, March ro, 1528. He died like a hero. His wite, who
courageously exhorted him to firmness, was herself put to death three days later,
only it was through the waves oi the blue Danube and not through fire that she
entered the presence ol the Master who loolrs with pity and lorgiving love upon
His followers' vain attempt to bring in His kingdom by the sword. The lite ol
Hubmaier has been written from the sources by Johann Loserth, Briinn, 1893.
