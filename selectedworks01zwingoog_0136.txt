Preble and George W. Gilmore.

On Monday, October. 26, 1523, the Second Disputation was held in Zurich‚
again between Zwingli and the representatives ol the Old Faith and other
clergy, and in that Disputatiou lor the first time the Baptist party in Zuricb
made their appearance. The subject ol the debate was what position the
reform party should take in regard to the use ol images in the churches and in
regard to the sacraments. The Baptist partyin Zurich were the radicals. The
origin ol tbis party was in a sort ol inqulry meeting—that is, some members ol

siastic lriends, because such actions were on the side ol disorder, and it was
very important to guard the growing Reformation lrorn the charge ol disorderly
conduct. At the same time he could not say that what they did was in itsell
wrong, as he bad himself advocated the removal ol all ornaments lrom the
