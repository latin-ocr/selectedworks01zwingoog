*circumcisiom since circumcision is external and corporeal, but
this ir internal and spiritual. For we leam here that Paul
:attributed our externals to the Hebrews, though they had the

internals alone, but the extemals not in the same form but ·
differently. No one denies that they ate spiritual-bread just as ’

we, ior they, like we, were saved through him who was to come.
But they did not carry around the bread and wine in the supper,

but used other externala in place oi these, manna and water from

accordance with the age oi each class. But he iound no other y
external than baptism, ior what cause would there be ior making ἵ
a comparison analogically between baptism and circumcision, ¹

when without that he could have spoken oi the spirit being
renewed, unless he had wished in the same way to make equal

the interuals as well as the externals, as he did in 1 Cor. x. 1? ’

It must be therefore that Paul entertained this opinion, that our
circumcision is baptism; this he would never have held unless
he had seen at that time the children of Christiane baptized as
he had formerly seen them circumcised.

V. Not only three, as above, but many families were baptized
by the apostles, in which it is more likely than not that there
were iniants. This, too, pertains to probability, about which
enough hasbeen said above.

Now we come to testimony. You will put together here, good
render, whatever hasbeen said oi one and the sarne testament,
people and Saviour. And you will at the same time consider
here thatin the apostles' time no one used any Scripture but the
