true of all its parta (as every one sees you do think when he looks
closely into your teachinga), you are wholly in error. For thetis
not synecdoche where, as we have said, what is said of the whole
ia true of each part, for then there is no figure. But thetis
synecdoche when a part of any body is received'tor the whole, or
the whole for a part. I have shown this by the clearest examples.
Still, that you may be supplied with all abundantly, hear this. In
Ex. xxiii. 17 it is written: Tmee times a year all thy males shall
appear before the lord thy God. Notice this word ‘⁴ all.” Tell
me, then, were infanta in the cradle from all Palestlne carried
thrice a year to Jerusalem? If so, theu according to your argu·

ment, they ate unleavened bread for seven days, sowed the fields
and offered the firstfruita. But since they did not do this it
follows that [all] malea were not included. If they were not
brought it is not true that every male appeared thrice a year
before the lord. “All males '' is therefore synecdoche, and

however on first appearance it seems as though every male is
ordered to be present at the three feasts, they alone are bound
by the law who were so old that they could receive the instruc-
tion or offer firatfruits or bear branches of trees, according to the
variety of the feast or manner of celebration. So also when Deut.
xxxi. rr-13 speaks of appearing at the reading of the law at
the celebration of [the feast of] tabernacles it appears that those
boys came who were beginning to understand what was read.
So also Luke ii. 42 shows from Christ, who when 12 years old
was a participant at the Passover, that they appeared who could
themselves make the joumey and understand what was done. At
the feast of Pentecost it appeared that they alone went up who
offered the firstfruits, a duty of the father or his representative.
Here therefore is synecdoche. Again, Ex. xxxiv. 19: Every
male that openeth the womb shall be mine. This can not bear
synecdoche. For it so pertains to all the firstbom [males] that
none is left exempt. I think you now see how crude and un·
learned is your argumentation, since you do not deny synecdoche
