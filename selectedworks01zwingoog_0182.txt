enjoy leisure so as to do nothing, then they eat in common. So
with wives, not to do away with the Republic of Plato,* they make
common not their own, but others. This is proved by the iol-
lowing: One oi their leaders lived in avillage about five miles
out oi the city,† a man oi considerable wealth. His wile came to
him in haste when he was going away that he mig'ht leave some-
thing for the children. She asked blood irom a stone. Mean·
while the wife remained for the night, perhaps hoping that δεῖ
blandishments would win somethingfrom him, and when the
bour arrived she sought the couch oi her husband, and the spirit-
ual man replied to her: Did I not tell you that you came only for
lust? He then cast her off, and called to him a Catabaptist girl.
When the wife, ioreboding evil, opposed this, he devoted her to
evil. ‘⁸ You are camal,'’ he said, “and so you think and suspect
carnal things. llou will be damned eternally.” Since her sus·
picion was iu no way shaken by the maledictions, she came to us
and told us what her husband, elsewise so impatient of lust,
imposed upon them to believe—i. a, about spiritual marriage„
For there was room for the suspicion, since he had gone with the
same girl on several occasions to St. Gall, and alone with her hadr,
passed not only through groves and shady places, but had occu--
pied her couch during the night. Now finally he disclosed the
mystery-—there was a spiritual marriage between them-to whiclu
statement the wiie gave no credence. So this fellow would have

’ , left his wife common to others that he might leave something

common (he never touched her afterwards), unless she had kept
her marriage vows with better faith than he, and took a common
girl, or rather, made her common.

Iwill give also another example. There were elsewhere also
those who contracted spiritual marriages aiter a similar fashion3
by silver rings they purchased of jewelers they bound girls and
women spirits to thern. There were such in the school of Valentine,
