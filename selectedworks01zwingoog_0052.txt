selves. For we think you are brave enough to do right without

that most of the ecclesiastics have already chosen wives, not
only among our Swiss, but among all peoples everywhere, and to
put this down will certainly be not only beyond your strength but
beyond that oi one iar more mighty, it you will pardon our say·
ing so. Accordingly, scom us not as oi little account; evena
rustic often speaks very much to the point. And though we be
but little children, we are yet Christ’s, and iar from scorning us,
you may confidently trust that salvation will be yours if you
receive us. As to ourselves, we shall never cease to sing your
praises if you but show yourseli a father to us, and shall render ·
you willing aud glad obedience. Grant a giit to your children,
who are so obedient that they come to you before all things, and
so trusting that in this matter, however difficult it is thought to
be, they have ventured to appeal to you only. The Most High

God long preserve your Excellency in prosperity and in the ’

knowledge oi God! We pray with all humility that you will
take all we have said in a spirit of justice and kindness.
