those things we promise with an oath, for the very least ot our
possessions we cannot change. But some do not ,believe the
simple precepta oi God, saying, 4: Since God swore ‘toilbraham
by himself who was God, at the time when he promised to be
kind to him and to be his God, ii only he kept his precepts, why
may I not also swear when Ι make a promise to any one? We
reply: Hear what Scripture says—when God wished to offer a
promise to his heirs, with surety that his counsel would not
change, he interposed an oath, that we might hope. Listen to
the import ol this scripture: God has the power oi taking an
oath, which he prohibite to you, tor to him all things are possible.
God gave an oath to Abraham, says, Scripture, to show that his
counsel would not change, that is, since no one could resist llis
power, so it was necessary that he should preserve his oath. But
we cannot, as was shown above by the word oi Christ, lreep an
oath ordo what we have sworn to do, so we ought not to swear.
Again some say that it is in the Old Testament, not in the New,

heaven sweareth by the throne oi God and by him who sitteth
therein. You see how to swear by heaven is forbidden, for itis
the throne of God 3 how much more serious to swear by God
himself! Oblind and ioolish, which is the greater, the throne
or he that sitteth thereon? Some even dare say: If it is wrong
to swear even when the Lord's nanre is used to support the truth,
then Peter and Paul sinned, ior they swore. To this we reply, 6:
Peter and Paul only testify to this, that by God himself a promise
was made to Abraham by an oath, but they themselves maleno
promises, as the examples clearly reveal. For testilying and
swearing are entirely distinct. When an oath is taken something
is promised ior the future. 7. To Abraham when an old man
Christ was promised, whom we received aiter a long interval.
But when one testifies he testifies to something present, whether
