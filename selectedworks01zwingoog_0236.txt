says: ln one spirit we are all baptized into one body. But you
Catabaptists yourselves argue that it one comes to the Iord's
table, he must first through baptism have become oi Christ’s
· body. Ido not say this because now or hereaiterl wish to
teach that circumcision or baptism introduces one into Christ,
⁸ but that Ι may show that the circumcised or baptized are in the
body oiGod's church, although I talre no exception to the
change ot form: We are baptized in'to one body, instead oi ι
We who are ol one body are baptized in one baptism, tor by
nature being oi the body precedes bearing the marl( oi the body.

So also Paul says: In one spirit we were all baptized into one χ ’
body. The grace oi the spirit by which we are admitted into
union with the church precedes the sign ot union. For no one
is sealed unless he has first been enrolled in the army or service.
1 therefore am coming to this: Ii they who are baptized in one
- baptism have come into one body, doubtless they who were sealed
with one circumcision, the sign of thecovenant-they were also
gathered into one body. Hebrew iniants were sealed with cir·
cumcision, the sign of the covenant3 they were therefore under
the covenant. Since they were under the covenant, and God
spoke with that body which was joined with him by the covenant,

whether we will or not we are compelled to confess that the ·

. , words: ‘⁸ ll ye hear and keep ”are a synecdoche by which iniants
are not excluded, even though certain things do not apply to
them. Ι will give another example, to try il they can in any way be
made to see the truth. Plutarch reaches in his bools, “ On the delay
oi the divine justice,'’ '⁶ that a people, a city or a tribe is one, even
as a man is one. It therefore makes no difference ii races, cities
· and peoples are not punished as soon as they transgress, ior no
