ἶ used the prophet’s word in the temptation of Christ, the prophet's

word did not become the devil’s; and again, when the demons
cried out: “ Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God,'’ so
salutary a confession was no less salutary because a demon made
it 3 so when the pope baptized not in his own name, but in that
of the Father and Son and Holy Ghost, it could in no way be
vitiated so as not to be the baptism of Christ’s church. In the
second place Christ himself said: “He that is not against us is
with us.” The pope therefore has this much of good, that he
baptizes in no other name than that in which we were baptized 3
in this he is with usas was he [with Christ] who expelleda
demon by the power of Christ’s name, although he neither fol-

left those marriages intact. This is clear from the testimony of
Paul in 1 Cor. vii. 13, where he commanded the faithful wife to
dwell with the unbelieving husband, provided she did what was
pleasing to him. This is nothing but the confirmation of the
marriage laws which each nation had, even of those marriages
entered upon in idolatry. Equally therefore we may not repudiate
abaptism which is not only not founded upon the pope's invention
or authority, but depende upon the authority of Christ himself
and the apostles. For the popes baptized in no other name than
that of the Father‚ Son and Holy Ghost. But in whose name do
they suppose marriages among idolaters were made? Yet the
apostles left these marriages whole and intact, no matter what ’

the laws and gods under which they were undertaken. The more ”

therefore will baptism be untouched by us when it is given in that·
name in which we give it, even though the pope have adminis-
tered it. Then they offered as objection too hatefnlly the matters
of salt, butter, saliva, mud and that class of things, nay, even the
