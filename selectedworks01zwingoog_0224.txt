REFUTATION OF BAPl'lST Tlttcxs. 211

But “dejerare'’ is used ior swearing, either truly orialsely‚ outside of
sacred obligations, which we might translate into German by a new
word, ‘⁴ auschwiiren‚” equivalent to the Greekword ἑπωρκιιν. Sothe
latin has three words, ‘⁴ jurare‚” “dejerare '¹ and ‘⁸ perierare ;” the
first means a sa‘cred obligation, the second to swear oli-hand to
anything either falsely or truly, the third to swear ialsely. Christ
¹would not iorbid us to swear [“ jurare ’'], but to swear lightly or oli·
hand [“dejerare ”]. But as these men do not, or will not, see this
(I have often set it forth to thern), they willingly and wittingly
stumble. But to show this is the sense oi Christ’s words Ι will
examine the words themselves, as follows: Ye have heard that
it was said by them Of Old, Thou shall not incapacia, τ’. 6.,
“ dejerare,” or swear lightly. Our translation has it, ⁴‘ Thou shalt
not commit perjury,” which is not wholly bad. For the word
“perieram’' though never used in a good sense, does not always
indicate the violation or transgression or pretended iulfilment oi
an oath, but sometimes it means ‘⁸ dejerare,” when “ dejerare ”
is used in a bad sense. For “deierare ” is sometimes used in a
good sense, as 1 have sometimes observed. While therefore the
words ol Christ are: It was said by them oi old, Thou shalt not
commit perJury, you will nowhere find among the Hebrews this
interdictos perjury‚ nor among the Greelrs. But you will find
in Ex. xx. 7: Thou shalt not take the name oi the lord thy
God “ temere,” which our translator translates “ in vain.” llou
will lind, Lev. xix. 12: lle shall not swear by my name falsely,
where the Greek interprete: οὐκ ousiosis τῷ ὀνόματί μου επ’ ἀδίκῳ, t'. e„
Ye shalt not swear hy my name to that which is wicked or ialse.
The Latin translates: Non perjurabis in nomine meo. llou see

how elegantly the divine Jerome has used here the word per-³5

jurare ior ialsely “dejerare‚” not ior violating an oath. 1t was

therefore forbidden by them oi old (2) to talre the name oi God

rashly, i. a, as it is expounded in the passage from Leviticus—

not to swear to a falsehood. So in thern this opinion rose out oi 2
this understanding—ii the name ol God were talento that which l
