The Protestant Relormation in German Switzerland, as lor the most part in
Gemany and England, was largely dependent upon the good will ol princes
and other rulers, who joined it lor political ends. No one can gainsay the
great advantage ol their support. So in Zurich Zwingli endeavored to win
over to his side the members ol the City Conncil, rightly arguing that il suc-
cesstut he would he able to preach the Reformation through the canton, no rnat-

be allowed to hold a public debate, at which they should sit as judges, and
give the victory to that side which presented the stronger arguments. He
looked iorward with great conlidence to such a public debate, ior which he
had prepared the way by his preaching and writing and talking ever since he
came to Zurich in December, 1518. The City Council took up the idea, and
were perhaps flattered by the position they would take in this debate. They
issued the invitations to the people ol the canton and city ol Zurich and to the
bishops ol Constance and ol the adjoining dioceses. Zwingli prepared and had
printed 67 Articles as a programme lor the debate, and looked lorward with
great eagemess to the time set, which was the 23d ol January, 1523.

On that eventlul day six hundred persons—priests and laymen ol the canton
ol Zurich, along with a lew delegates irum the bishop ol Constance and some-
others—met in the Town Hall and held the debate, which is preserved to us
by Erhart Hegenwald, a sch'oolmaster in Zurich, who informs us that he wrote*
it lrom memory immediately alter hearing it. His account was edited by
Zwingli and published in Zurich. John Faber (or Fabri), Vicat General ol
