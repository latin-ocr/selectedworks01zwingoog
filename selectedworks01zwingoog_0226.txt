oath [required by magistrates]. For which ol the Hebrews ever

took [such] an oath by heaven, earth, Jerusalem or his head? On
the other hand, who does not swear off-hand by these? One man
promises something by the cross of Christ, another asseverates by
heaven and earth. This then is what Christ forbade. To this
he directs the wind-up oi his whole discourse. Let your speech
be such that yea means yea, and nay, nay. There you have it.
He does not speak about our oath 3 he does not touch upon the
forum or court or magistracy, but upon daily conversation in our
familiar intercourse.

Perhaps I seem to some to argue ior this opinion tamely. But
it they weigh as often as Ι have done the passages from Exodus

I know they will think as I do. llou see now whether enough

does not come, be is not accused oi falsehood, nor does any
one blame him, ior God gives him the excuse of necessity. So
also when he is summoned toan enquiry by the magistrate under
oath, his reply is not such that the power of almighty God cannot
rightly exempt him. For when Abraham swore to Abimelech
himself, did he not swear to do something? Why then did he
do it? Especially when the Catabaptists declaro that he could
not do anything, and assert that Christ meant that? Under the
