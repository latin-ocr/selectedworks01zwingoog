mon people; the leaders are the authors, as you may know from
the following example: At S. Gall there was a Catabaptist girl oi
about 12 years or a little more. She was the daughter oi a right
thinking man, as they say. He was preparing one day to carry
some provisions (he is a provider oi grain) when his daughter
wamed him to remain at home, ior he would see something
wonderful. A little aiter she iell down in the way I described
above. And when she was waking up she babbled out those
empty ravings oi theirs. You see how she knew when she was
going to iall. Why did she not sall down at once when she saw
her father leaving? Why, she had not been taught all she should
say when coming to consciousness, nor been told oi all that
there was need oi in accomplishing the affair. Every now and
then they use these tricks still at Abtzell. And they call it an
attestation, though it applies to things past and future, so that
those vain seducers oi old women cannot say that when any one
testifies, it is oi the present. Oh, how sweetly and gently do
they arrange everythiog. Ye gods and goddesses above, below·
and in between, bepropitious to them!

' though in many places they have said yea, it has never been

yea. When those leaders are banished against whom Ι write
especially, and are asked for an oath, they will not take oath, but
say that through the faith which they have in God they know
they will never return, and yet having been seen returned, they say
the F ather led me back through his will. I know very well that
it is the father ot lies that brings them back; they pretend to
know it is the heavenly Father. This is worth telling: When
that George (whom they all call a second Paul) oi the house of
Jacob [Blaurock] was cudgeled with rods among us even to the
infernal gate, and was asked by the senate's officer to take oath
and litt his hands [in affirmation], at first he refused, as he had
