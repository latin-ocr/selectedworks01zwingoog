With the help oi God then I will reiute the loolish, impious and
absnrd arguments adwanced hythe Catabaptists, a few passages
oi Scriptnre being addnced, bnt such as that whole crowd cannot
resist.

1. 'lbe Catabaptists teach that the dead sleep, both body and
sonl, until the day oi judgment, because they do not know that
“sleeping” is used by the Hebrews lor “ dying.” Then they

, do not consider that the soul is a spirit, which, so lar from

being able to sleep or die, is nothing but the animating principle
ol all that breathes, whether that gross and sensation-possessing
spirit that quickens and raises up the body, or that celestial spirit
that sojoums in the body. That celestial spirit then that we call
soul the Greeks call entelecheia [i. e., actuality] ; this is so lively,
enduring, strong, tenacious and vigilant a substance that its nature
iorbids the absence oi action or existence. Its nature is incessant
action or motion. So that it can as little sleep as the light or the
sun can be an obscure body. Wherever you drive the sun it glows
and lrindles, as Phaethon experienced.† So the soul, no matter
whither you drive it, animatas, moves and impels, so that even
when united firmly to the body, which itseli under its own inertia
sleeps, yet the soul sleeps not. For we recall what we have seen
in sleep. Much more when ireed from the body is it incapable
oi sleep, since it is a substance suited ior continuous activity,
incapable ol weariness. So the body sleeps, the soul never, but
when it is ireed from the body this last sleeps the eternal night
Finally the Catabaptists are ignorant that hythe Hebrews the
resurrection oi the dead is not always received of the supreme
resurrection oi the flesh, which we shall some time see ; sometimes
it means this, sometimes that, continuanee and existence oi mind,

‘Allnsion to the Frankiort (on the Main) Autumnnl Fair, which was the
great book mart nt that time ; the date ol this treatise being July 31, 1527.
