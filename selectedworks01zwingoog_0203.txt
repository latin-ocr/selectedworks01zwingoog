irum ourselves, 01 which Christ also speaks. Who hstes his own
lile in this world, he says, saves it lor lile eternal. This separa-

tion results when we daily set forth a desire ior betternrent, and
with our might exhort the brethren to this by example and
prayer. But according to this we do not seek to be separate
irum those who have infirmities in common with us. Tbe thing
itseli warns unii only we be truly pious and cherish God, how
iar in each case we must bear. Nay, we should hear piety alone
in this matter ol condemning or seceding, so that establishing

men who arraign the audacity 01 the men. And it is strange
that they have 'omitted here what elsewhere they have urged as
a prime obJection. In the assemblies oi the city [they allege]
murders often talre place-as ii this did not happen more ire
quently in the maritet place and the country. According to that
we must not assemble in the country or the maritet place. They
condemn also the processions to the churches3 they do this with
