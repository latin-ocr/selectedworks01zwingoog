they who trust in works make Christ of no effect. For if justi·
fication is by the worlrs of the law, Christ has died in vain. Third,
they yet do not conceal it so thoroughly as to betray their opinion
by no sign. For when they say that remitted are the sins of all
who wish to walk in the resurrection of Christ and to be buried ’
with him in death, they elevate free will, and next to that justifica-

circumcision was most often given to those who could neither
make confession nor demand. But you reject the whole Old
Testament. This is what you clearly betray in the former con·
futation. This point ought to have been treated by me, but it

· has fallen out. lt therefore comes in properly here when you

say: ¹There is no need for me to seek baptism in the Old Testa-
ment. By which do you not despise the Old Testamenti And
yet Christ submitted himself and his teaching to it, and the
