REFUTATION OF BAP'l'lST TRICKS. ¹ 151

template himself with pleasure, but that he may descend into
himself and weigh both himself and his [works]. He will find
such corruption that he will not rashly think highly of himself
whom he finds so low, or have alow estimate of another than
whom he sees himself no better. Since then even human reason
perceives, when it is quite franlr and thrusts itself into the hidden
recesses, that man is altogether evil, with what boldness do you
assert trust in human innocence? Or will you perhaps say that
we must not trust at all? According to your opinion then we
shall all be adjudged to ultimate condemnation. For if felicity
must come by our innocence, and this innocence is wholly denied
us, then felicity forus has perished. Then why do you simulate
innocence? Why do many of you take to themselves these words
of Christ and boast: Which of you convicteth me of sin? I
therefore judge that this is the result, whether you assert that
innocence is man’s and from this innocence (which the apostle
calls righteousness) felicity [flows], or whether you deny it, your
hypocrisy is made clear. For if you insist that¹ felicity follows
from our deeds‚ reason and common sense oppose. What have
you to do with sacred Scripture, which you so hold as a supple-
ment or appendage that you lay it aside whenever you please?
If you deny that it [innocencei] can be obtained, why then do
you pretend that what you see can pertain to no mortal, that
you hold with both hands? Read again and again this refutation,
I beg, and you will come to know yourselves, unless you are more
obstinate than the demon. What then? At Wonns you deny
Christ, and lead the way back to trust in works, because the men

¹there who have recently become interested in religion are little
trained in the wiles of hypocrisy, and so are susceptible to your
triclrs. For when they see your squalor and hear also your
sounding words about innocence they assert that you have assumed
this squalor that you might the more put on God; they therefore
receive you as men of God, and supply richly what they possess.
For what chest is so firm that it will not yield to such sanctity,
