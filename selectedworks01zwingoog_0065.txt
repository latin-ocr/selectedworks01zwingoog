these matters? According to my opinion whatever such things
one would discuss should be brought before the universities, as
at Paris, Cologne or louvain. (Here all laughed, for Zwingli
interrupted by asking: “ How about Erfurt? Would not Witten-
berg do?” Then the legate said: “No; Luther was too near.”
He also said: “All bad things come from the North.'’) There
one can find many taught in the Scriptures, who have ability to
handle so great subjecta. In this remark I do not wish to be
taken as speaking to the discredit of any one's honor or knowl-
edge, but as a Christian member, and with entire good nature'I
announce this. But as faras my office and commission are
concemed‚ 1 have been sent here, as I said before, forno other
purpose than to listen, and not to disputa*

written down. Now speak and give answer if we did not dispute iore and
aftemoon about a judge, when Master Ulrich Zwingli declared that he
would not suffer any one as judge except all Christian believers. Have

matters pertaining to the interpretation of the Scriptures before the councils.

between scholars, and always in times of misunderstanding in regard to the
Scriptura, the universities have been chosen as judges. But when one of you
spoke, his words were considered as flowing from the spirit of God, as if into
you alone the spirit of God enters (as St. Paul writes), and you alone were the
wine-rooms of Jove, and all secrets oi the empire oi God were made known in
them; but what the holy Fathers spoke, wrote and ordained‚ and also the ·
