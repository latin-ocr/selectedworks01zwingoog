had made, but although Judah the son of Israel was designated
ss he from whom the Saviour should be born, yet the rest ol the
tribes which came ol Abraham were not excluded irom the cove-
nant or lrom his friendship that he had given to their {ather
Abraham. Just as he did not change anything with those who
afterwards were ol Judah, yet not ol the house ol David, who
was himseli peculiarly marked out as the father oi the coming
Christ, all were regarded as under the covenant who had de·
scended from Abraham. Now to return to the point. This, I
say, is the Israelitic or Hebrew people whom the Lord marked
out as his own peculiar people from all races and peoples, so that
it should tower above all peoples, just as the colleges oi priests
stood forth prominent among that race and all races, as he testi-
ties in his words in Ex. xix. 5: Now, therefore, if ye will obey

my voice indeed, and keep my covenants, ye shall be my excel·
lent people, i. e., my own peculiar and sought-out people oflall

peoples although the whole earth is mine. And ye shall bea ’

kingdom consisting of priests to me and a holy race.

Here then the Catabaptists have a medicine or plaster lor their
whole error, it they would suffer it to be applied. If ye will hear
my voice and keep my covenant, he says. Here is God speak-
ing synecdochicallyl For when he addresses the whole people:
It ye hear my voice and keep my covenant, etc, which can be
referred to those alone who hear and can have desire to keep the .
covenant, yet he no more excludes infants because they do not
hear or understand what is to be kept than they who were bound
in sleep or mentally. For they who are of one body are consid-
ered together. But since inlants are ol the people ol God, they
are not excluded because they cannot hear or understand. For
that they arc members ol one and the same body ol God's people
is clear irom this, that circumcision, the sign ol the covenant, is
given them. For God with his own mouth named both the
covenant and the sign ol the covenant, because he who was oi
the covenant was scaled with this sign. Paul in 1 Cor. xii. 13
