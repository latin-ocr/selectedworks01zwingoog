in the passage: They who believed were together, yet contend
that all must be predicated oi each part that is contained in the
whole oi which the synecdoche treats. But you do not consider
the composition oi the word itseli-sun and ex with dechomoi, asli
you would say: When I talre the whole body I understand some·
thing separate irom among those things which are together
included in that body. Or: When I take some part oi the body
Iunderstand the whole body. So that the Latin comprehensio
does not quite correspond with the Greek. · Then when you con·
tend thus: ii then iniants were counted among the believers, or
were made believers, they also broke the bread, a thing that
cannot at all be, and so they were not baptized. For it they
were baptized, they would also have broken the bread. You
reason wretchedly, so that it is clear to all who read your produc·
tions with judgnrent that you are all impostors. For since you
leaders are not so untaught as not to see how wretchedly you
reason, and since none the less you offer to the untaught vicious
syllogisms, you cannot be saved from being impostors even by
the Saviour himself. For what constralns it to follow here that
they who were baptized also broke bread? Were there not
among the ancients circumcised infants who yet did not tear the
lamb nor eat unleavened bread? Or because thrice a year they
were not present, were they therefore not oi God's people? Leam
then that infanta were counted among believers and were bap-
tized, and that oi believers those actually believed, prayed, dis·
tributed property, brolre the Lord’s bread, who bad come to such
age and understanding as to be fitted ior this and subject to the
observance, as is clear from the examples drawn from Euodus
and Deuteronomy. Every male was directed to be present at the
feast, the women and boys at the reading oi the law; but how·
ever the letter reads, by synecdoche is understood every class
according to its manner and understanding. What have squalling
[infanta] to do with the reading oi the law, or adolescents with
the offering oi lirstiruits, unless the father directs them?
