direction than to prove that they are as much initiated by our
sacramenta as we ourselves. It follows therefore, first, that in
Paul's time it was the custom of the apostles to baptize infanta ς
second, it any one contradicts it he vitiates the opinion ot Paul.
What does this man here than the like? He says we are not
superior to them, and they are not interior to us. He attributes
to them then the same sacraments as we have, and to us the
same as they had, as in Col. ii. 11. Those ancients could not
all be baptized exactly as we are unless we were all baptized with
our lamilies. All these therefore being baptized and made equal
with us, it is clear that as all their inlants were baptized in the
sea unto Moses, so also in the time ol the apostle believers’ chil-
dren were baptized unto Christ.

NowI return to the point, and assert that the children are
spoken oi by synecdoche in: All crossed the sea. For to be
accurate crossing occurred only to those who were oi an age and
strength to cross, and that all ate the same spiritual food when
those alone ate who were spiritual, yet none the less itis said of
all that they ate. So also in this place, it Paul had used the
word “ all '² and had said: All ol Stephanas’ iamily have given
themselves to the ministry ot the saints, yet by the very force ot
synecdoche the iniants also would be understood to be ot the
family, and [lilrewise] that they who then had believed had
given themselves to the Iord. For this is the nature ot synec-
doche, that when as to any body that has different parts, and
those parts are similar in some respects and different in others,
anything is predicated ot the whole body, itis understood oi a
part, and what is said oi a part is understood of the whole.
Here is an example ot whatI mean. All Judea went forth to
him. You see that “All Judea ’' is put ior those who went out,
and the synecdoche is two-told. One puts the container for the
content and the other the whole for a part: the Judean region
tor the inhabitants, all the inhabitants ior a good part oi them.
On the other hand see Is. iii. 16 ι Because the daughters oi Zion
