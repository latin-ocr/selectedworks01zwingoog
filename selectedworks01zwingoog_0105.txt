After this the mayor of Zurich permitted every one who did
not belong to the council to go to his lodging and dine,'uutil
further request, for it was now approaching noon. But the
councilors the aforesaid mayor ordered to remain, perhaps to
consult further concerning this* Thus they arose, and many of
the strangers went to their lodging. This much was done in the
forenoon.

Ι After all had eaten they were told to appear again in the city
hall to hear the decision made by the wisc council of Zurich.†
After all had gathered, there was publicly read before the
council as is written hereafter:
When in the name of the Lord and upon the request of the
mayor, council and great couocil of the city of Zurich, and for

the reasons contained in the letters sent to you, you had
obediently appeared, etc., and when again a year having passed
since the honorable embassy ol our gracious bord ol Constance, on
account of such matters as you have heard to-day, was here in
the city of Zurich before the mayor, small and great councils,
and when these matters having been discussed in various fashions

lalso can prove it with the Scripture's, and thus 1 feel like the honest old
peasants: when one wishes to abolisb their old traditions and praiseworthy
usages, which are not contrary to God‚ they do not like to obey and allow it.
And thus Ι leel in regard to the said sayings, 1 trust to Christ and God and the
Holy Ghost that thus lar they have not deserted us, arrd Ι say also agree with
St. Jerome, that in regard to these matters Ι shall rightly hold to the faith
which Ι have received from the maternal breast. Although the doctrine ot
yoursell and your brethreu would be very acceptable to me, for 1 would not be
allowed to pray, last or do other good worlrs, but il Ι did them Ι should com·
mit a sin, therefore Ι would probably go to heaven. But since perchance 1
cannot ask much, therefore 1 do not wish to lose the intercession ol the saints,

and especially ol the virgin Mary.” (Faber.)]

he from Fislishach was murdered does not wish to appear to fightfl ]

t[“which has been decided upon in accordance with the debatc beld.”
(Bullinger.)]
