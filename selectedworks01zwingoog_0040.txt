or even to destroy the real heralds oi Christ, they will meet with
’ the same result. Therefore must the words ol Gamaliel be
pounded into them often, that they may keep their hands off oi
those who bring us the commands of heaven. For if it be of
God it cannot be destroyed, for it were iolly for any to try to
light against God; but if it be of men it will perish of itself.
Meanwhile most watchful care should be taken lest, as those poor
wretchesperished miserably in their doorned city, some disaster
overwhelm us unawares. For the word oi God has never been
disregarded with safety. Therefore, Most Reverend Father, we
beseech you by our Iord Jesus Christ, not to join those who
aim at putting under a bushel, nay, at extinguishing, the light
that came into the world to illumine all men, and who call evil
good and good evil, turning sweet into bitter and light into dark-
ness, but rather to join those who have this one desire‘, that the
whole concourse of Christians return to their head, which is
Christ, and form one body in him, and, having received the spirit
of God, recognize the blessings bestowed upon them by God.
And this we see is by no means the case with those who promise
themselves some sort of peace, it human prescriptions be set
before Christ even. In God we ought to be made one, for he
himself is one. In man, who is constantly divided against him-
self, how is it possible that we be made one? Christ prayed to
the Father to make usone in him, and shall man dare to promise
us unity in him? In one God, in one faith, in one baptism we
shall certainly he made one, for these are one. In some one
man, when there are so many laws contradicting each other and
such divergent opinions, so far are we from being made one that
in no surer way can we be led astray into error and disagreement
than in this. Nay, we see one and the same man often at vari-
ance with himself in these points. Those things that we set forth
a little while ago and all other things that urge us to unity,
whence can they be more clearly and purely got than from their
very fountain head? He that draweth from that shall abound
