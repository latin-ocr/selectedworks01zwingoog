she does nothing according to ber own will or what she thinks
lit, but seeks only what the spirit ol God demands, calls for and
decrees. Tbat is the right Cburcb, the spotless bride oi Jesus Christ
governed and reireshed by the Spirit of God. But tbe Cburch
which is praised so highly by the Papists errs so mucb and
severely that even tbe bratheas, Turlrs and Tartars know it well.
But when he refers here to the words ol Christ, Lulre x. 16,
“He that heareth you bearetb me, and be tbat despiseth you
despiseth me,” aod then refers this to pope, bishop, regeuts oi
the Roman churcbes, 1 say that such is not the meaning of Jesus
Christ, that we should obey them in all things as they order.
For Christ the Lord knew well that such great braggarts would
sit upon the chair of Moses who would burden the neclrs oi the
poor with unbearable and beawy loads, which they themselves
would not toucb with a finger. Hence tbe saying, “He that
bearetb you hearetb me,¹' etc., will not serve lor that ior which
the papists and sophists interpret it, but the right meaning is, as
is also shown by what precedes and follows. Wben Christ sent
his disciples to preacb the Gospel in country and city he spake:
‘⁶ Go ye and preach,” saying the kingdom oi God is approacbing,
etc.. And later Christ said: “He that receiveth you receiveth
me,” as Matt. x. 40 says. This means tbey should preacb His
word and bring it to tbe people, but not human ioolisbness and
law. For one serves tbe Lord in vain ii one prefers human
doctrine and decree. And may the good gentleman iurtbermore
remember what Jerome writes in ad Jovinian concerning the

¹ invocation or intercession oi tbe saints that be bas not read

correctly. For it is written ad Vigilantium3 but how Jerome
twists the Gospel in regard to invocation or intercession oi the

saints, as he does olten in other places, tbat all know who read
¹ Jerome witb good judgment.' Finally, in regard to the canon
