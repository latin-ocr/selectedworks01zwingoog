he did not want this thing laid up against us, and so left it free.
Theretore our souls which had been nigh unto despair were
mightily refreshed when we learned those who were unable to
receive the saying were threatened with no punishment by him
who can send both body and soul into hell. But the fathers
Υ seemed to have cast an anxious eye in this direction too, when

they showed themselves unwilling to enjoin chastity upon all
