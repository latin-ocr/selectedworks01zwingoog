Rom. i. 16. Afterwards in Acts x. 34 he says: Of atruthI
perceive that God isno respecter of persons, etc, as I have
hinted above. Here Peter proves that Christ is also of the
Gentiles. We have therefore one and the same Saviour. Then,
too, in Acts xi. 18, where Peter tells how the whole affair with
reference to Cornelius happened, it says: When they heard these
things they held their peace and glorified God, saying: Then
bath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life (for
the word repentance is here used synecdochically for the gospel
itself, as I have elsewhere shown). We see therefore attributed
here to the Gentiles what formerly he said belonged to the Jews
and their children.

Also r Pet. ii. 9: But ye are a chosen generation, a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should show
forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into
his glorious light, which in time past were not a people, but are

now the people of God, which had not obtained mercy, but now
have obtained mercy. By these words of Peter we see that

Christian people are now that elect race which the Hebrews once
were, as Ι have shown above from Ex. xix. [5, 6]. Also the same
royal priesthood which is now of all nations, which also belong
to God (for the whole earth is his), and which the Lord holds
in honor and as of value just as he formerly held the Jewish race
as a priesthood of all peoples. A hely rece, from which infanta
are not excluded-posterity belongs to the race as much as
parents do-a people sought and obtained by the blood of Christ.
Which people was not a people once (for he alludes to Hos. i. 9),
but now is the people of God. Therefore we are they who
formerly Abraham and his like were.

All these things, to shorten sail in this part of the discussion,
make ior this, that we rnay know that it is one and the same
testament which God had with the human race from the founda-
tion of the world to its dissolution. For God is not prosphatos,
