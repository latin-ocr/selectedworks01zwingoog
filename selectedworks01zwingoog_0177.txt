excluded. This I ask you to prove from sacred scripture. Ι
hear it said: Infants are excluded, but nowhere bya divine
oracle. Here the whole dispute hinges. There was a strifc
among the apostles whether the gospel should be preached also
to the Gentiles or not. This strife tested partly upon a false
inference, partly upon probability. The fallacy was this· To us
the Christ was promised, therefore not to the Gentiles. But who
isso unskilled as not to see that it does not at all follow: The
Messiah was promised to us Jews, therefore not to the Gentiles.
For it may be that he was promised also to the Gentiles, and the
Scriptures testify to this in various ways. So in the present
passage: The writings of the apostles testify that they who heard

and believed were baptized, but it does not at all follow that ,

children were consequently not baptized by them. For it may
at the same time be true that the apostles baptized believers,
and the apostles baptized children. Just as it is true: The
Hebrews circumcised adults, they also circumcised infants. For
when adult, nay, decrepit, Abraham inflicted upon himself the
wound of circumcision and upon the infauts Ishmael and Isaac.
You are mistaten therefore, 0 Catabaptists, when you make an

indefinite proposition exclusive. An exclusive is either, no one
ought to be baptized except he who first believes, or infants
ought not to be baptized. But from: The apostles baptized
believers, and from: The apostles are not said to have baptized

believers, it does not follow. For “The apostles baptized
believers,” and “ No one may be baptized unless he first believes ”
are not equivalent. So also with: “ The apostles are not said to
have baptized infants, therefore these were not baptized by them
and may not be by us.” For it may be that they baptized both
believers and iniants, and also either that they baptized infants,
but the fact was not recorded, or that they did not baptize them,
and still these were baptized by the ministers of the churches or
may be rightly baptized. For [the apostles] were sent above all
to preach, not to baptize. If you impute sophistry to me here,
