At such complaint the Vicar from Constance again arose, and
spoke as follows: Tbese remarks are meant to refer partly to my
gracious Lord oi Constance and partly to me as his Grace’s Vicar,
therefore it is proper that I answer them. The good gentleman
-I really do not know who he is—spoke first as follows, saying
that this year our gracious Lord of Constance issued a mandate
ordering people to keep the constitutiones hunuanus, that is the
human ordinances and praiseworthy' customs. To thisl say,
dear lords and gentlemen, there are truly many unfair, ungodly,
unchristian opinions and errors at hand, which very often are
preached and put before the people, not only here in the
Coniederation, but also elsewhere in my gracious Lord’s (of
Constance) bishopric by unskillful preachers, which opinions
and errors, my dear lords and gentlemen, serve more to disobedi-
ence, disturbance and discord than the furtheriog of Christian
unity. For they desire to estrange us from the good old inherited

:ustoms aad usages descended upon us from our old pious Chris-
tian fathers many hundred years ago. Perhaps it was with this
in mind that my gracious Lord issued the mandate for the sake
of peace and unity in his Grace's bishopric. Of what the real
contents ol the mandate were 1 have no accurate knowledge,
forat that time, as is known to many, I was absent from home.

that also the evil spirit might, as an old scholar, use and know the Scriptures—'
and Matt. ii. 6, where the scribes cite the saying ol Micah ot Bethlehem, but
omitted the following correct point-thus by means ol these two quotations l
have well proven that it is not always sufficient to cite the Gospel or the Scrip-
tures (although they have the first seat and the greatest honor), and that the
Scriptures do not consist in the reading, but in the correct interpretation3 thus
and not otherwise it was done. Why didn't you note that down also forme?
Why do you conceal that from me? And in still more unfair and wronglul
lesbion did you note down this and other of my speeches, how 1 so often cited
the pope and the pope’s affairs.” (Faber, correction.) “When you cited
how also the devil had made use of the Scriptures, Zwingli had answered that
is what he was there lor, to give answer that he had used them correctly. But
you do not wish to take hold ol the Scriptures.’' (Hans Hager in “Gyren-
ruplen.”)]
