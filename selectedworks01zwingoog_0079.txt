time of the holy pope Gregory (ΙΙ.) it has continued in use
among all Christianity, it seems strange to me that now ior the
first time people desire to consider this wrong and erroneous,
contrary to Christian ordinance, although there are lew men who
do not leel the aid of the mother of God and the dear saints,
not alone among us Christians, but also among some unbelieving
heathen. If we here at Ztirich are now to speak and fight against
such customs common to all the world, and especially those pre-
served so long by Christians, let each one think for himseli how
that would please those in the Orient‚ the Occiderit, from sunrise
to sunset, also those in Hibernia, Mauritania, Syria, Cappadocia
or in the Cyclades. 1 do not need to mention countties nearer
our lands. Truly, dear sirs, it would be well to consider before-
hand what dangers and dissensions might arise for Christianity it
one were not in harmony and agreement with the whole com-
munity in these matters. For you see, as also a heathen called
Sallust in “Jugurtha ” testifies, that small things arise from unity,
but from dissension great things decrease and fall away. There·
iore my advice would be, not to consider anything oi these affairs
which pertain to the whole Church, but to save them for a
general council. And although Master Ulrich refers to Bibles
in Hebrew‚ Latin and Greek, and thereby consoles himself, which
Scripture also those here present being taught sufficiently well in
the three lauguages should examine, and such Scripture as is
pertinent to the case they should iudge and consider, still I say,
in the first place, that is not a small gift ol God to (be able to)
expound the above-mentioned lauguages, andi do not boast that
1 possess it. For these are especial gilts oi God, as also Paul
says to the Corinthians (xii. 7—1o): Unique datur manifestatio
spiritus ad utilitatem, to each is given the manifestation ol the
spirit ior use, to the one laith, to the other eloquence‚ to this one
the interpretation ol languages, etc. Oi these greces or giltsl
cannot boast oi possessing any, as I know nothing oi Hebrew‚
am not well taught ln Greek, and understand latin only tolerably.
