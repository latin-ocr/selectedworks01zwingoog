able, wise, favorable, gracious, dear gentlemen, it is necessary
that 1 also speak in this matter. Last year I was lector at
Luceme, where, according to my best knowledge and beliei,1
preached, as Ι hope 3ηά know, nothing else except the word oi
God from the Scriptures, and in these sermons at Luceme 1 have
mentioned, like many others, the many useless customs oi inter-

holy Scriptures. On account oi such sermons, made, as stated
above, at Luceme, various accusations against me were sent to
Constanee, among which was the sermon about the invocation oi
the saints. I was accused of being a heretic, condemned, 3ηά
therefore driven out oi Luceme. And now as my lord, the vicar,
has pretended before 3ηά stated that the appeal and invocation
oi saints is founded upon the Scriptures 3ηά mentioned in the
Old Testament, Ι pray for God’s sake that the vicar, as he was
wont to boast to have overeome the priest imprisoned at Con·
stance, show the place, as iormerly olten had been asked oi him,
especially since on account of this I have been accused by my
gracious lord at Constance oi being a heretic, and I will accept
it with many thanks 3ηά willingly allow myseli to be taught in

case I have perchance erred in my sermons, have not told the
truth, or have misread or misunderstood the Scriptures.

on earth.
