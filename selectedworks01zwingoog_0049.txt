And this passage is as like unto the passage above as one pea is
like another. The seventh is likewise from rTimothy, ch. iv
1-3: “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
times some shall depart irom the iaith, giving heed to seducing
spirits and doctrines oi devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having
their conscience seared with a hot iron, iorbidding to marry,” etc.
Here we would have those prick up their ears who make a fine

it is iar more desirable it we marry wives, that Christ’s little ones
may nothe offended, than if with bold brow we continue rioting in
iomication. To this your Highuess will no doubt agree when you
reflect that the sin oi him who offends one oi the little onor of
Christ can scarcely be atoned for, even though a millstone be
hung about his neck and he be cast into the depths oi thesea.
And what, pray, is a stumbling block of offence, it the shameless
