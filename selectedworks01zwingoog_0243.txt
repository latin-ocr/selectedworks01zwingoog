had passed. Here we see one vineyard, one Master, and (what
caused astonishment in the workmen) one equal reward to all. ’
What does this signiiy to us but one heavenly Father‚ one vine-
yard -the church‚ one reward—Christ, i. e., salvation through
him?

But let it not occur to any one that the aucients had access to
God, not by Christ, but by observance of the law—a thing that
some seem to think because there are two testaments, one that
leads to servitude, and the other which is in freedom oi the
spirit through Christ. They think then that theold requires
observance oi the law ior salvationum Christ, not seeing that
the law even when kept does not save. For ii righteousness is

long time into the vineyard. It is also clear what the bosom of ξ
Abraham is, about which many have anxiously inquired. For it
can be nothing else than the sodality oi the early believers to be
. everywhere preserved for the coming oi Christ. For just like
Abraham, since they were justified by saith, they desired to see
