’ they were disputing with Arius they did not accept men, but the
’ Scriptures, as judges, as one finds. When Arius said it is also
proven by the Scriptures, as he thought, that the Son of God is
less than the Father, John xiv. 28, the dear fathers sought the
Scriptures, allowing them to judge, and showed that it was written,
John x. 30, “I and my Father are one.’' Also, xiv. 9, ro, “He
that¹ hath seen me hath seen the Father. Believest thou not
that l am in the Father and the Father in me?’' Also, “The
Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.'’ Such declara·
tions of the Scriptures the dear fathers considered, and showed
that Christ had two natures, human and divine, and proved by
the Scriptures, not by the judgment of men, that the saying
which Arius quoted, The Father is more than 1, referred to the
humanity of Christ and the later sayings spoke of the Godhead,

that he would allow all Christians to recognize not only several, but all, whether
he had used the Scriptures rightly or non and he asked who was judge between
⁴ Hilary and Ariana, between Jerome and Jovian, between Augustine and the
Manicheanst with nothing besides the Scriptores they proved their cause, and
thus allowed it to come before all people without a single judge. And what
you attaclred afterwards, ju'st as if he had boasted of great abilities, that you
invented. For Zwingli spoke of the rest who were there thus: There are in
the hall probably men as learned in Hebrew, Greek and Latin es at Tubingen.

theretor “ Zurich has probably as many people learned in the three languagee

those at Lyon and Paris.”]
