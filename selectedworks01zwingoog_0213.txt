1t is no strange thing that so many sects are born daily3 itis
wonderful that more are not produced, especially when we have
so wise interpretem 01 Scriphrre that they do not yet discrimi-
nate between Christ’s omnipotence, providence and divinity, by
which he ever goveros all, and his mission which he performed
here. For when they behold that which he did in accordance
with his mission bere immediately they found upon those laws.

is given 101 discussing necessary matters, he always passes from
the gross to the spiritual. But here in passing by this he openly
