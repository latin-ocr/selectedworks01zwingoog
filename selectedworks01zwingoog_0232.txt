nnwrnrron' on nnvnsr umens. 219

Render to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is his. So
they are told to render to Caesar what is his. But they owe the
oath. Therefore Christ orders it to be given.

But before we leave this a waming ought to be given the =
tyrants of this world, who though they falsely boast in the name

pass so daring a deed unpunished. So whom he might have
utterly destroyed he made wretched and full of misfortune.
, When he drove him from Paradise he did not forbid him to
become a father, but simply that he should not be the father of
