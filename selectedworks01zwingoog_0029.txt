request oi the president and the uhworthiness oi their course,
they went back to their seats. Thereupon I began to spealr in
deience ol the teachings oi Christ to the best oi my ability, and
made answer to their main heads in about this iashion:

1.' My lord suffragan has stated that certain persons were
teaching seditious and obnoxious doctrines, but I cannot be per-
suaded that be means this to be taken oi me, who ior nearly tour
years now have been preaching the gospel ot Christ and the
teachings oi the Apostles with so much energy. And yet it
savors somewhat ot this, inasmuch as he made the statement
before the Senate. For what concern were it oi mine ii such
teacbings were preached elsewhere, provided they were not
preached at Zurich? ThereIore, since it is not likely that the
suffragan spoke ol the affairs ol outsiders, it is clear that his
remarks were aimed at me. However much they disguise it, it
is evident that here is the David to whom this Nathan imputed

’ the wrong. But as to the gospel, it is no wonder that in one

place or another there should be differences between those who
cling doggedly to έντάλωατα, that is, human prescriptions, and
those who are uniriendly to the same. For Christ prophesied
most clearly that this would come to pass, saying: “I came
not to send peace on earth, but a sword. For I am come to set
a man at variance against his father, and the daughter agar'nst
her mother, and the daughter-inlaw against her nrother-in·law,
arrd it shall come to pass that a man's loes shall be they ol his
own household.¹' Yet there was no need oi this answer either.
For Zurich ruore than any other oi the Swiss cantons is in peace
and quiet, and this all good citizens put down to the credit oi
the 'gospel ,

a. As to the reproach, in the next place, that it is taught that
no human prescriptions nor ceremonials ought to be kept, I will
acknowledge lrankly that Ι desire to see a fair portion oi the
ceremonials and prescriptions done, away with, because the things
prescribed are in great part such as also Peter in the Acts says
