pastor, perhaps unwisely‚ in order to proclaim to you the word ol
God, the Gospel oi Christ, which l shall try to do according to
my best capabilities, in as far as the grace oi God will assist me
and the Holy Ghost aid me. But surely now many ordinances of
man have been retained from long habit in the churches, and have
intermingled with the Gospel, so that the clergy frequently have
preached and commanded their keeping equally with the Gospel:
yet I now declare that l shall not obey such human ordinanceS,
but shall present and teach from love the joylul aud pure
’ Gospel, and whatever I can really prove from the Scriptum,
regardless oi human ordinance or old tradideras, since suclr
human ordinances‚ decreed by pope or bishop, have been
here recognized and proved to be by the Articles* emanating
{rom Master Ulrich to be entirely opposed to the Gospel and
truth, and still there is no one here who desires or is able to say
anything truthful or fundamental against him. And so although
my Sir Vicar has pretended to prove and show by means of the
Gospel the invocation and intercession oi the saints, such has not
yet been done, although frequently requested. Therefore 1 also
pray to hear and to know from him where it is written in the
afore-mentioned biblical books conceming the invocation and
intercession of the saints. For perhaps also in my sermons,if
God lends me grace, it will be declared and proclaimed that one
should invoke to Jesus Christ alone, and only look to him lor all
compassion, all help, mercy and salvation, which shall be sought
and demanded from no other being. Thereiore, Sir Vicar, l
desire that you teach me if l have erred, aud report from the
Gospel, showing place and location where it is written that the
saints are to be invoked by us or that they are intercessors.
Such I shall receive with many thanlrs, and will gladly allow
myseli to be taught by you.

*keternng to the Sixty·seven Articles issued by Zwingli lor the basis ol
argument in the Disputation.
