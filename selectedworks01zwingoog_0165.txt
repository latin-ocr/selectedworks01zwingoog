Worshippers oi the bellyl At Grtiningen you deny the Old
Testament, ior you see there many who are not affected by a
pretence ol sanctity, and detest the boldness with which you tallr
about “ spirit '³ when Scripture does not suffice. Since therefore
you see that catahaptism from which you hope as irorn a fountain
to derive all your counsel, is proved by no Scripture3 while infant
baptism can be defended by the Old Testament, you reject the
Old Testament. Since then you disparage part of the Old and
part of the New, you only show that you are the very worst and
most fickle oi men, indeed atheists. For while you draw from
the records which are written about Christ the matters that con-
cern baptism, you make Christ himself oi no account. So it is
known to all that you do everything ior contention’s sa'ke, however
much in hypocrisy you simulate sanctity and simplicity. F urther,
since you reiect the Old Testament ior the reason that you cannot
endure what is deduced from it in reference to iniant baptism,
you clearly evince that you make oi no account him who is God
both of the Old Testament and the New. Let me not seem too
immoderate, dear reader. You will see that in all matters the
case oi these people is worse than my pen can show. What
hidden ulceris that they cherish-but why do Ι say hidden ulcer,
when it is not hidden that they deny both the Old Testament
and Christ himself? Weigh a little careiully their words, which
we copy here. Paul, they say, teaches that whatever is not in
the gospel or discourses oi the apostles is anathema. llou see
how openly they reject the Old Testament. You see them as
wishing to appear to strive by Scriptum, yet distorting Scripture
as they do here by Paul, even making that Scripture lie which
Christ called in as testimony. And have the apostles taught·
anything that they had not drunk in or proved irom this Scrip-
ture? A fine and learned saying that: “ Whatever is not in the
gospel or in the discourses oi the apostles, let it be anathema.'''
