For having persisted in the statement that none is to be baptized
but he who can repent, you will rightly assert that infante may
not be baptized. But here there is need of a law forbidding,
and you have no law. You therefore are the law, and where the
lion fails you, patch on the fox. And why not? What one of
your brethren weighs how correctly or incorrectly you reason?
But we, who are accustomed to essert nothing not abundantly
founded and supported by divine testimony, we know that Isaac,
even when an infant, belonged to Abraham's family so completely
that he compelled his father to send forth the servant and the
child born of her. Does not this seem so to you? But Paul
joins Moses in saying: The son of a maid-servant shall not be heir
with my son Isaac. He was heir, and doubtless of the family.
For even they who are not beirs, such as slaves and freedmen,
are of the family. I do not care to plead here that by lawyers
this son whom you disinherit here is declared a member of the
family. I hasten to this: Ex. xii. 48 we read—we who go to
the Old and the New Testament as to two lights to preventus
from being deceived, while in the meantime you support your-
selves on your own spirit—as pearls do on their own absorption
when nothing flows into or moistens them from outside-—we read,
I say: And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and keep

· the passover of the lord, let all his males first be circumcised‚

and then he shall rightly keep it. Why is said here: All his
males? Does this pertain only to adults? Why then the precept
to circumcise every male on the eighth day? Yet infants are not
of the family. To me the opposite seems true, for they possess
heirship. But it is yours to prove by Scripture that they who
received the sign oi the church of God in accordancc with the
rite and religion of the parents belonged not to their parents’
family. But that you will as soon do this as cut through an
isthmus I will show by other evidence. In Acts xxi. 5 Luke
writes: And after some days we went on our way, all bringing
with us wives and children, etc. Were the children here only
