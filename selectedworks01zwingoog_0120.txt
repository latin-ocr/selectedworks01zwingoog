THE FIRST ZURICH DISPUTA'I‘ION. 107

v.‚ vi. and vii. chapters. After that let him read the other gospels,
so that he may know what they write and say. Alter that he
should take the Acts. Alter this the epistles oi Paul, but first the
one to the Galatiam. Then the epistle ol st. Peter and other
divine texts; thus he can readily form within himself a right
Christian lite, and become more skillful to teach this better to
others also. After that let him work in the Old Testament, in
the prophets and other books of the Bible‚ which, I understand,
are soon to appear in print in Latin and Gemran. Let one buy
such books, and never mlnd the sophistical and other empty
writings, also the decre and work oi the papists, tell and preach
to the people the holy Gospel, written by the tour evangelists
and apostles, then the people will become more willing and skill-
iul in leading a peaceful Christian ure. For matters have reached
such a state that also the laymen and women know more oi the
Scriptores than some priests and clergymen.

Thereupon spoke a priest, decan of Glatttelden:

Shall one then not read Gregory or Ambrose, or cite their
writings in the pulpit, but only the Gospel?

ZWINGLI.

lies, you may read them. And when you lind something
written therein which is like the Gospel or quoted from the
Gospel, there is no need of using Gregory or Ambrose, but one
first of all honors Christ and says,.this the Gospel or Scriptures
tell us. And this is not only my opinion, but Gregory or ᾖ
Ambrose is also of this opinion. For the dear fathers them-
selves confirm their writings with the Gospel and Scriptures, and
where they depeud upon their own thoughts they err readily an
generally.

Another priest, by name Hans v. Schlieren, asks:

But what shall he do who has a small benefice and not suffi
cient wherewith he could buy such books, the Testamenti 1
have a poor little benefice; it is also necessary ior me to speak.
