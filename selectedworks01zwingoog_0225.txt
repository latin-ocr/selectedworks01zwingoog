was true no harm was done even though this was in ordinary and
daily ducourre, but that it was not permitted to appIy it either
as ‘⁸ adiurare ” or '⁴ dejerare” to a light, vain, iaise, fictitious or
lying matter. This opinion it was that Christ combatted, think·
ing that they ought not ‘⁸ dejerare '³ either to the true or false in
ordinary discourse5 everything was to be said and done so truly
