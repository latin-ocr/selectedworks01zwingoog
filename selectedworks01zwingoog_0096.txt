that we appeal to the Virgin to intercede ior us3 this the mother ol
God herself says in the gospel of St. Luke. Ex hoc beatam me
dicent: “All generations shall call me blessed,'¹ and her cousin
Elizabeth addressed her in a friendly manner, saying: Unde mihi
hoc, etc.“ And whence is this to me, that the mother oi my iord
should come to me?” Likewise, “ blessed art thou among women,”
etc. This also the maiden in the Gospel proves to us, who eries:
‘⁴ Blessed is the body which has horne thee, and blessed the hreasts
which thou hast sucked.'¹ [Interruption by Zwingli: We are not
asking eonceming the holiness and dignity ol Mary, but concern-
ing invocation and intercessionj We also sing daily: Sentiunt
omnes tuum levamen. “All feel thy aid who honor thy mem-
ory.”' But since my talk is held to be useless and ioolishl
will rather keep still.

Thus the vicar kept still and sat down, and theu Doctor Martin
irom Ttibingen arose, and spoke thus conceming these matters:

Dear Sirs: Mueh has been said here against the usage and
ordinance ol the Christian ehurches which has been decreed and
ordered by holy councils and fathers assembled in the name oi
the Holy Ghost, which, moreover, long has been held without
fault as a praised custom and long usage. To oppose and to
object to itis a saerilegious deed, ior what has been decreed and
resolved hythe holy councils and fathers, namely, by the lour
councils, should be obeyed in Christian ehurches like the Gospel,
as we have written in Diss. XV. For the Chureh assembled in
council in the name ol the Holy Ghost cannot err. Thereiore
it behooves no one to speak against their decrees and ordinances,
as Christ bears witness in the holy Gospel when he says: Qui

vos¹ audit, me audit. “He that heareth you heareth me, and he
that despiseth you despiseth me.” Thus Christ speaks to his
disciples and those who in place of the twelve apostles (as bishop
and pope) govem the Christian ehurches; as then the Roman

‘ [⁴⁴ Show us that in the Scriptures; the rest is human nonsense.” (Bull-
iassui]
