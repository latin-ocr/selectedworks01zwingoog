excluded. For we have proved that by comprehension (i. a,
synecdoche, unless the Latin word is less appropriate than the
Greek,) they are included. In that you promise to show how I
had asserted synecdoche only by twisting Scripture, again you
are rich in promising, but poor in tulfilment. For when you
would tear away synecdoche, you establish it most firmly.
Catabaptists. As in Acts ii. 44: All who believed were
together and had all things common. Here, says Zwingli, if
believers alone were there, whither had they removed the intents?
It they had cast them off, they would have been fine believers to

For what else will they when they deny that they are included
among the believers, and put thern in what all have common?
What tiger, pray, is so cruet? Surely to this pitch ol insanity
ought they to corne who have put off not only the sense ol piety,
but also all human sensibility. Here I beseech you, pious heart,
not to take offence at what I am about to say. For here it

must be pnt down (not that I yield so much to passion, bnt that
those things ought not to be ignored by all which those people
