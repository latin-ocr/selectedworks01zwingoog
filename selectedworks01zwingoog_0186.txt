Lord's Supper because they were baptized. Similarly they must
have prayer with the other believers, ior the preceding and iol-
lowing context is as follows: And they continued steadiastly in
the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking oi bread
and prayer. Who steadlastly continued? All that became
believers. Il then infauts became believers, or were numbered
with thern, they also hroke bread, which no reason can make out,

Reply. Why do you charge me viciously with a skill in arguing
which I never assumed, but [which] is deceitlully attributed by

that you act not only impiously, but inhumanly, when you prefer
to include believers' infants among baggage and goods rather
thau among believers. lt, however, you have come to the poin
of confessing this discourse to be figurative indeed, but here
require of synecdoche that whatever is said ol the whole body be
