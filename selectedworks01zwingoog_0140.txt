which the heavenly Fsther so lately sowed in his field must be
on its guard,I beg this, that we watch, act, and not let the enemy
overthrow us as we sleep. Let us judge soberly, lest we receive
a wolf in sheep's clothing. Let us labor, lest that evil that has
arisen be attributed to our neglect. For there are, alas, nota
lev among us who are stricken and moved by every wind and
novelty, just like the untaught rabble which embraces a thing the
more quickly the more unknown it is. The Catabaptists speak
in round tones ot God, truth, the Word, light, spirit, holiness,
flesh, falsehood, impiety, desire, demon, hell and all that kind ol

and recognize as wicked the hand made bloody at St. Gall with a
cruel parricide, so that you see without difficulty that the same
thing is to be expected from their assemblages (which are both
nocturnal and solitary), which once at Rome improperly idle
matrons when they had gained possession ot a certain paltry
Greek perpetrated in their subterranean meetings. And although
all those deeds are in part so wicked and unworthy ot good men,
in part so obscene and impure, and in part so monstrous and
cruel, that they would hand this age down to posterity as iniam-
