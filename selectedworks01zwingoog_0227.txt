law, they say, it was permitted to make oath. But Abraham

made this reply on oath 430 years before, and he was not under ἶ

the law, but under laith. For the apostle makes him our father ¹

by raith. It is clear then that Christ spoke against that insanity
under which many swear oi their own motion so irivolously and
promise something as ol their own authority, or swear not to do
what they could not avoid. They also call to witness ior any
sort oi thing, not only the names ol heaven and earth, but also
oi the living God, thus bringing contumely upon God to their
own evil.

(4) When they seelr to wealren that example oi God swearing
to Abraham himself, do they not wealren themselves? How
olten have they said in the loregoing that we are to do what we
see that Christ did? But they add, this is possible to God-to

ot Christ? So 1 say: Christ could love his enemim, I cannot. ,
So 1 must not. You see, good reader, that although they try and Ἴ

or at least ignorance, as in this case. For in their persuasive
discourse from the words: “For thou art not able to change one

obligation known as an oath.

(5) They reason from the less to the greater: 1r one may not

swear by the throne, how much less by God himself who sitteth ¹
upon it? Not inaptly do they inlesit they spealr oi perjury or ’
oi swearing lightly. For il God lorbids swearing lightly by his
throne because it is his, how much less should we swear lightly

by him? But ii they speak oi the obligation [oi the oath], they
infer wrongly that ii we may not assume an obligation by his
throne we may not by himself. An oath is not legitimately

taken and as it ought to be, “any created thing,'’ but “by God '⁹ l

himself. An oatb is a religious matter; he who makes oath
binds himself to the sum oi religion; in religion the chiei thing
