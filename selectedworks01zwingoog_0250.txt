Ι REFUTATION OF BAPTlST TRICKS. 237

concamed, were not the same, does not oppose the truth‚ ior so
iar as meaning is concerned they were the same. For as circurn-
· cision was the signature oi the covenant, so is baptism ; as the‘
Passover was the commemoration oi the passage, so is the
eucharist the grateful memorial* oi Christ's death. Whence
the divine Paul, 1 Cor. v. 7-83 x. 18, and Col. ii. 11, attributes
baptism to them, and also the eucharist or spiritual leasting on
Christ, but to us the Passover and circumcision, and so makes all
equal on both sides. So iar upon one and the same testament,
church and people of God. ’

I am now compelled to treat oi election, or else iorego my
promise, but not so fully as the subject demands. For this is
beyond my power and purpose. But Ι shall show electiori to be
sure, i. e., lree and not at all bound, and above baptism and
circumcision ; nay, above iaith and preaching. But this briefly.
When most oi us read Paul's epistle to the Romans we pondera
little carelessly upon the cause oi his nrentioning election and
the following predestination. He had shown that salvation rests
on faith, and iaith is not a matter of human power, but oi divine
spirit: who therefore has iaith has at the same time the divine
spirit. They who have this are sons oi God, walk not aiter the
flesh‚ bnt whatever they do is a help to thern ior good. Now
arises the query, why then are they acursed or condemned who
do not believe? Since he has fallen on this subject, willingly or
not, he treats it worthily about in this order and manner: We
are saved by saith, not by works. F aith is not by human power,
but God's. He therefore gives it to those whom he has called,
buthe has called those whom he has destined ior salvation, and

he has destined this ior those whom he has elected, but he has '

elected whom he willed‚ ior this is free to him and open, as it
is for a potter to make diverse vessels irom the sante lump. ¹This
