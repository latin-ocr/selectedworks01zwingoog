20 ZWINGII SELECTIONS.

without a man that entering into him can delile him.” Here Ι
shewed by the argument from the preceding (in the way they
manipulated the sacred writinga) that the argument ol the
following held good in this way: Therelore‚ whatever is outside
of a man cannot by entering into him defile him. Words are
signs to me. A general negative is no sign. Ilhe had said
“ uo lood,'' he would have leit out the category of drinks3 ii he
had said “no drinlr,” he would have leit out that ol food.
Therelore, it pleased him who is the Truth to say “nothing'’
Then he added “cannot even defile.'' Hear! The Voice ol
Truth declares it cannot; man, who is a liar, lor all men are liare,
says it can. Here the man squirms and says these words are not
so clear, and must be interpreted in this way, but the preceding
words must be regarded and the words that follow, though this
is what follows: “Do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing
lrom without entereth into the man it cannot delile him, because

Holy Fathers and the councils.” Ι answered that Engelhard,

Christ to eat meat at that time. While Ι lorbid no nran's
tasting, Ι leave it free to him.

8. They had also added: “and contrary to very ancient
custom.'' Here I lrankly granted that it was the custom, and
not a bad one. But it it were the custom, why was a proclama·
tion added? Ι promised that Ι would certainly see to it that
the custom should not be wantonly interrupted.
