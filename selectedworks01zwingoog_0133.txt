First, a general ordinance: That no one shall enter into
matrimony in our city and country without the testimony aud
presence ot at leat two pinus, honorable citizens in good standing.

EXPLANATION OF THIS ORDINANCE.

No one shall marry, engage or give to another his son or
daughter without the lavor, knowledge and will ol the father,
mother, guardians or others, who are responsible for the young
people. Whoever transgresses this shall be punished according
to the manner ol the case, and the marriage shall be invalid.

Now in order that marriage requirements may not be made
lower than before, no marriage shall bold whicha minor shall
enter into without the knowledge of the above-mentioned, his
father, mother, guardian, or other people responsible, as have
been named, before the minor is fully nineteen years old. But
it it happens beiore this, then the ones mentioned, the iather,
etc, can hinder it and nullily it. But in case these are careless,
and have not provided lor their children in the nineteen years,
then the children may marry and care for themselves, with God's
help, unhindered by any one and without any payment. Neither
father, mother, legal representative or any one shall force or
compel their children to a marriage against their will at any time.
But where that has happened, and is legally reported, it shall
not be valid and the trespasser shall be punished.

Marriages that have been arranged ior or already consummated
shall not be ¹hindered or disturbed, as is right and proper, in any
degree, by anytbing‚ cause or reason, except the clearly expressed
causes as are i'n the holy Scriptures, Leviticus xviii.

And what has heretofore been aehieved by dispensations and
money shall be done away with eutirely, and cause no more
trouble.
