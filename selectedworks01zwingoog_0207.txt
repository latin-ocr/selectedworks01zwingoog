Reply. We hare seen in a former paragraph how perplexingly
and confusingly, captiously aud obscurely they treated ol separa-
tion from abominatione, for their cause had little justice in ir.
Here we see how clear they are when they deal with their church
(it is wonderful, the effrontery with which they call it a church)
and their pastors. There they were after this one thing-to
show their treachery legitimate, both because of the morals of
men and the bishops, and they were torn by conflicting emotions, l
and, as is said, held the wolf by the ears. For if they extrava-
gantly blamed the morale of the faithful they would incur the
charge ot evil speaking and malevolence, but it they thought
moderately well of them, those whom they had brought over to
themselves would nothe sufficiently aroused to their secession.
So since they dared not spealr freely, both because of tear aud
cantion as well as because of the injustice of their cause and
malice, they concluded to spealr obscurely and suspiciously‚ so
that none attacking in open contest might easily catch the oily
and chameleon-lilre adversary. For when you were going to say:
Why do you encourage secession lrom the churches of the faithful, l
they would be ready to reply that they taught only separation from
the evil, and that legitimately. When you objected that you do
not denounce separation from the wicked‚ but that they seem to
spealr of separation from those whose life is wholly endurable,
they could reply by heaping up, iu dramatic forestalling of objec-
tions, what they can in no way correctly defend—the world, those

out of the world, good and evil, God and the devil, Christ and l
Belial, etc. By this you could be led to reason thus. It rs true y
what they say 3 all things known are either divine or worldly, and l
so if you found aught worldly in yourself you would condemn
yourself, even if you should have commerce with worldly matters»
and so being aroused would go over to the betrayers, not reflect-
ing that when you had gone over to them you would at once find
