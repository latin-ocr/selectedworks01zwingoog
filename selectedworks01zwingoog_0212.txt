:r them, but now since there is nothing bitterer or more harsh
:a [than they] , it becomes evident that gentleness is taught by them
just as we have heard that temperance was taught once by a
³2: most eager glutton. For when any edible was brought in oi
y which he was particularly fond, he used to warn his table-com-
panions not to swallow it hurriedly and hastily, but quietly to
4 dwell upon it and to masticare it for along time, and so increase

aa the pleasure by lengthening it, in order that he might gorge him-

self the more abundantly. So since there is nothing harsher
than these (for what age has ever seen such evil speaking?)
ἦ, they reler others to Christ to learn gentleness, while they thern-
..³1 selves go as far from his example as possible. Then they adduce
the example of Christ when he dealt with the woman adulterer,
dv y. a, he did not hand her over to be· stoned, but regarded her
with compassion, and said: Go aud sin no more. Indeed they
t . write all this charmingly, so that you may the more easily under-

stand that those spirits are even now propitious to adulterers.
But look here, you slothlul and over-sensitive fellows, have you
not read that Christ gave all sorts ol precedents in accordance
with the diversity of occasions? How oiten do you read the
most cruel things? ¹Here then leam to recognize a divine and
punishing justice. How often, on the contrary, do you read the
most gentle? There recognize pity. Then in a word learn this,
that he whose first coming had nothing harsh in it, wilh that
same one there is also the most complete justice, but since in
that first coming his purpose was not to judge or condemn, but
to save, he preserved the limits ol his mission. Unless you show
me that somewhere during that advent he assumed the authority
ol a judge, you will never move me by that example [to believe]
that the magistracy is not lawlul for a Christian. This you
cannot de, ior he fled when once they wished to make him king.
But now that that mission has been completed, and he has sat
down at the right haud of God, see whether or not he has de·
stroyed cruel murderers and given his vineyard to other worlrers.
