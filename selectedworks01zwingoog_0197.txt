baptism, but you call “baptism ” that which is rebaptism. And
. while your words appear as though you were unwilling to admit
any one to the table oi the Iord unless he has been baptized,
what you mean really is that no one in your evil church should
hope to be a participant at the table oi the Lord unless he has

nothing oi our side, reader‚) that the baptism of the pope is not
Christ's buta demon's‚ in the following way: 1r baptism were oi
the pope alone, I would not object to their calling the pope’s bap-
tism either “not Christ's '' or a demon’s. But the baptism oi
Christ is not the pope’s, even though the pope were the arch-
