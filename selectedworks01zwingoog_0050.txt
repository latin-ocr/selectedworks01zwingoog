{omication ol priests is not a stumbling blocle ol offense? And
let your Highness not deign to listen to those who snap out like
this: “ Behold, Most Reverend Fathers, the religion of these
menl What else are they aiter than turning the freedom ol
Christ into the lust ol the flesh, according to the judgmenr oi
Paul to the Galatians 5 and ol Peter 1, ch. ii?” For to make no
mention now of how the cohabitation ol marriage is regarded by
God, although we do not deny that the act proceeds distinctly
from the flesh‚ yet we know that it is lar from harmful, since
Paul says (1 Corinthians vii. 28): “And ii a virgin marry she
hath not sinned,” because God no doubt looks without anger
upon this thing on account ol our weakness, or rather the sin
dwelling in us. And the same Paul (Galatians v. 19) reckons it

· not among the works of the flesh. Yet this answer is not neces-

sary,'since it is clearly evident that ir we had wished to indulge
in this thing lor pleasure’s sake, we should never have allowed
ourselves to be tied up with the halter oi wives when thus, besides
suffering countless arrogances, we are cut off from the oppor-
tunity ol making good the unpleasantness and other drawbacks
of a long married life. But since most oi us fill the office of
bishops, in which above all things there should beno room ior
grounds oi offence (ior a bishop¹ ought to be blameless‚ as has
been made clear above), we have all tried to see how we could
cease from the offence, while in other respecta (if we may spealr
ireely without boasting) we are not ol such untutored morals as
to be in ill repute among the flock entrusted to us ior arry other
iailing save this one alone. For the sake oi Christ the Lord ol

all oi us, therefore, by the liberty won by his blood, by the ¹

fatherly affection which you owe to us, by your pity oi our feeble
souIs, by the wounds oi our consciences, by all that is divine and
all that is human, we beseech you merciiully to regard our peti-
tion and to grant that which was thoughtlessly built up be
thoughtiully torn down, lest the pile constructed not iu accordance
with the will oi our Heavenly Father fall some time with alar
more destructive crash. You see what the world threatens.
