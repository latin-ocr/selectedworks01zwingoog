supplied all support they are hardly able to endure the labor ol
living. The atrabilious menl It is bile, and not the spirit, for
which they sell themselves. Do we not know that it is from bile
and an evil admixture that the crazy commit suicide? And are
we ignorant of those atrabilious fellows who labor with their own
impatience, and shall we trust their lies about the spirit? 1 know
that all is not borne along of its own will, but is govemed and
disposed by the providence of God, but at the same time I see
also that by his pmvidence these monsters are led like wild boars
into our liquid pools to prove us, so that it may appear whether

as follows: The sword is an ordinance of God outside of the per-
fection of Christ, by which the evil man is punished and slain
and the good man defended. In the law the sword is ordained
against the evil for punishment and death, and for this the
magistracy of the world is constituted. But in the perfection of
Christ we use only excommunication, for the admonishing and
exclusion of the sinner, lor the destruction nithe flesh alone, as
admonishment and waming tnat he sin no more. Here we are
asked by many who do not understand the will of Christ toward
us: Can a Christian use, or ought he to use, the sword against
evil for the defense of the good or from love? 'This replyis
therefore revealed to us unanimoust: Christ teaches us to leam
from himself. But he is mild and gentle of beart, and we shall
find rest to our souis. So Christ said to the woman taken in
adultery, not that she should be stoned according to the law (and
yet he had said : As my Father hath commanded me, so 1 speak),
buthe spoke to her with commiseration and indulgence and
waming not to sin again, and said: Go and sin no more. We

must in the same way observe this according to the rule ol ex-
communication.
