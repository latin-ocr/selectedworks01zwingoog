apostles used no other scripture, indeed they could not, since
until atter the beginning ol their preaching there was no Scrip

Here therelore your error, in which you do not consider the
analogy oi the sacrament as does the apostle Paul in 1 Cor. x.
and Col. iii, so that we ought not to neglect his example-your
error, I say, causes you to deny that in all Scripture the sign
