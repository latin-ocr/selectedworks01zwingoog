ur to exclude irom that those oi whom we cannot judge from
the signs oi iaith and uniaith whether they are included or not·
Oi Christiane, because we not only assail rashly the election oi

God, but we do not even believe his word, yet he by it has shown ³

us their election. For when he includes us under Abraham’s
covenant this word makes us no less certain oi their election
than oi the old Hebrews'. For the statement that they are in
the covenant, testament and peoole oi God assures us of their
election until the Iord announces something different of some
one. Therelore also that objection is strichen out: How then

were we sure oi Esau’s electiori when the Lord says: Esau have j

Ihated? For we iollow the law throughout. But it the iord

does something out oi the ordinary the law is not thereby ahto ¹

gated. For privileges do not make the law common. Though

indeed it is my opinion that all infante who are under the testa· ’

ment are doubtless oi the elect by the laws of the testament.

And when it is said: Where then do you put the iniant Esau? y

Under the testamenti But he was rejected. I respond two
ways: (1) All judgment ot ours about others is uncertain so iar as
we are concerned, but certain as regards God and his law. E. g,
when it is said toan apostle: I believe in Jesus Christ the Son
oi God, the apostle thinks him who says this oi the elect because
oi the certitude oi the word. But they sometimes deceive who
thus confess, as did Simon Magus and the ialse brethren who
came in secretly to betray the liberty oi the gospel. But God
himself is not deceived‚ nor does the law deceive, ior God knows

the hearts and reins, i. e., the inmost parts, and the law, if all is ἰ

just and right, does also not deceive, hut is eternal. Thereiore
we ever judge according to the law, as hasbeen said, and the
law ior the sake oi one or many may not be considered the less
universal. (a) ‘ibe other reason is such as all may not receive,
but to me it is sure. All oi those intents who are within the
elect, who die, are elect. And this is my reason, because when
I find no uniaith in any one I have no reason to condemn him 3
