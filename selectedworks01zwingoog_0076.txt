Theretore, my dear sirs, with regard to the impirsoned priest
there is truly no reason why my gracions Lord of Constance, or·
his representative, should be blamed ior this affair. For nothing
has been done other than what was proper, iair arrd becoming.
To this Master Ulrich answered as iolows: Dear brethren in ’
Christ, it doubtlessly happened, not without especial destiny and
will oi God, that my Lord Vicar has just spoken about the praying
to and the intercession ol the saints and the mother oi God. For
that is not the least oi the Articles issued by me, upon which I
have preached somewhat, and at which so many simple iolk are
troubled as though they were lrightened by a heretical [lit. un-
christian] sermon. For I know, and truly find in the divine
Scriptores, that Jesus Christ alone can bless us, who, as Paul says,
alone is the justice of all men, who has expiated our sins, and
He alone, our salvation and Saviour, is the means ol intercession
between His heavenly Father arrd us humans who believe, as
Saint Paul clearly says to the Hebrews, and as you of Ztirich have
often heard from me when 1 preached to you from your lavorite,
the epistle to the Hebrews. Now since my Lord Vicar announces
and puhlicly boasts oi how he convinced the imprisoned priest
at Constance, the clergyman ol Fislisbach, by means oi the divine
Scriptures, oi the lact that one should pray to the dear saints
and the mother oi God, therefore that they are our mediators
with God, I beg ol him for the sake oi God and oi Christian love
to show me the place and location, also the words oi the Scrip-
tures, where it is written that one should pray to the saints as
mediators, so that il Ι have erred, and err now, I may be better in·
structed, since there are here present Bibles in the Hebrew, Greek
and Latin languages. These we will have examined by those
present who are sufficiently well taught in the above-mentioned
tongues, so I desire no more to be shown than the chapters in
which such is written, as my Lord Vicar states, then we will have
it found and read, so that we may see whether it is the meaning
oi scripture that the saints arcto be prayed toas mediators. In
