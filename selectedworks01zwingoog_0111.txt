lords, hymen not learned in the Scriptores, who all could refute
your argument as presented until now, aud by means ol the
Gospel overeome and relute.

Very well, Master Ulrich, do you admit that, that one should
only keep what is writ in the Gospel, and nothing besides? Do
you admit that?

zwuvou. ,

Sir Vicar,1 pity you that you present such sophistical, hair-
splitting or useless arguments. Perhaps l could also indulge in
such devices, perchance Ι have also read it formerly in the
sophists,hence1 do not wish to be entrapped by such subter-
iuges and triclrs. I shall auswer and argue with the pure Scrip-
tures, saying there it is written. Th2t is behtting a scholar, to
defend his cause by the Scriptores.

VICAR·

You have read in St. Paul that he accepted aud taught tradi-
tions which formerly were not written in the Gospel! [Zwingli

‘[“l'hat 1 said and say still, that we are bound to hold many things
that are not openly written, but which the Church holds and we believe,
and iurthermore have been reported by the teachers ol the first churches
as having come to us by order ol the 12 apostles3 thus 1 wished to prove
that the iorty days’ last, also the Sunday which in the Apocalypse St.
John calls 'diem dominicam‚' was decreed by the 12 disciples; ir we do not
wish to despise, depose or suppress them, then it is fitting that what so many
centuries by Christendom generally, also hythe heretics, has been held we
should also lreep, even il it be not openly printed in the Scriptures.” Further·
more he remarks: ‘⁶ It is a harmiul error not to admit anything unless it be
expressly described in the Scriptures. The Sadduceaus also denied the resur-
rection because it was not expressed in the Scriptures. Ipraise you all that
you preach the Gospel and St. Paul, lor that is the right rock. But what we
have also lrom the time ol the 12 apostles you should not cast so carelessly
aeide. ll your speech were true we would be obliged to leave the ‘symbolo
apostolorum,’ the ‘homoousio,' yes lrom the persons in the Godhead, lrom

iree will; we no more could believe that Anna was the mother ol Mary,’' etc.
(Faber.)]
