them they straightway are able to say they are hostile to them
because they have assailed their vices. Now any one oi the
people who hears this will suspect the ministers of the church

and the magistrates before he does these many-colored deceivers: ,

aroused to lury they charge iorward at their command, ignorant
whither they are mshing or to what end they will come. Impu-
dence and audacity increase, so that he who to-day is a simple
hearer will tomorrow abuse the magistrate to his face. When it
is seen whither their increase is tending and resistance is made,
straightway he who is the instigator departs from the midst and
leaves the miserable people to be mangled by the executioner.
And they present a parallel to Ate r* whithersoever they turn all
is woe; they overtum everything and change things into the
worst condition possible. Some city begins to think more
soundly about heavenly teaching; thither they proceed and bring
confusion ς they do not introduce the iord to those which do
not receive the word. Who does not discern from this whose
apostles they are? Thereiore establisb your courage‚ good
bretbren. The hypocrisy oi the Roman pope hasbeen brought
into the light3 now we must war with hypocrisy itsell. And you
must do this with the less delay the more you see those apostles
of the devil, although they promise I know not what salvation,
seeking nothing but disturbance and the confusion oi affairs, both
human and divine, and destruction. So much about their division
and betrayal oi the church. They have gone out from us, ior
they were not oi us. Yet I may add this one item: there isa
small church at Zollicon† where the catabaptists set up their
teaching under inauspicious beginnings. This church, though
small (lor it is a partos the Zurich church, only five miles out),
is admirable in its coustancy. For now they have about over-
come the catabaptists born among them, having ever embraced

* The daughter oi Zeus, who induced gods and men to do rasb and incon·
siderate things.

† On tbe north shore ol the Lake ol Zurich, and five miles from the city.
