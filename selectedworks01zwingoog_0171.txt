It follows, he says, with insuit to the truth and wisdom of God.
Though they know neither, they affirm insult to both. But what
contumely is it to either God's truth or his wisdom that Hebrew
infanta were circumcised and included in the faithful familias?
But these words of theirs are high-sounding; thia is their mer-
chandise—bombast and words a foot and a half long. To words
of this sort, which they use in great rotundity, the unskilled mob
erects its ears and then applaude.

Catabapa'sa. Eighth. The last chapter of this epistle shows
that the apostle neither knew nor baptized children. Zwingli
dishonestly keeps this back3 it makes against his foundation of

lle know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits in
Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the service of
the saints -that ye submit yourselves to them and to every one
that helpeth with ua and laboreth. A family of this sort paedo·

Reply. As in many other places so here, we easily catch the
author of this frivolous confutation, although the greatest proof
is the Swiss tongue, in which it is so written that it has no foreign

had been bumt at the stake. The rumor was lalse and the editors made a slip,
as this treatise ol Zwingli’s is dated July 31, 1527, and the letter oi OEcolam·
padius is really dated August 18, 1527. (Works, viii., 85.) But the allusion
probably is to Conrad Grebel, as already stated ou p. 155. To burn among
the shades it was not absolutely necessary to bave beeu bumt at the stake first.
