THE EPISCOPAL VISITATION. 17

can not be endured. Noram I going to listen to those who say
that Peter spoke ot theold ceremonials and prescriptione. Be
it understood, though, that it 1 should grant them this it is still

the decrees ot certain most unholy spirits, who after the manner .
oi the Pharisees would lay unbearable burdens upon the necks of .
men and not touch themselves even with the tip ot their fingere,
were an abomination. And as to his having said, with a view to
rouse the Senate to anger, that we should fail to obey the laws ot
